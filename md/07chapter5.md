# **5th Story - Rebellions **

In the story titled *Rebellions*, the notion of an inescapable future is
starkly challenged. The phrase ‘There is no alternative’*,* famously
proclaimed by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, has
become a somber anthem of a global neoliberal order, dictating the terms
of economics, culture, and personal well-being. [^1]^,^ [^2] This
slogan, entrenched in the political and economic discourses, implies a
future devoid of transformative change, impacting not just the British
political scene but also casting a long shadow over global work,
education, and mental health.[^3]

*No alternative* is an assertion of capitalist ideology about the only
suggested way for social development; the capitalist economy is
considered the best and unique system that can work. The debate about
the alternative social systems supposedly ended in the last century with
the decline and collapse of the Soviet Union. The slogan also conveys an
optimism about how ‘Globalised capitalism, so-called free markets, and
free trade were the best ways to build wealth, distribute services and
grow a society's economy.’[^4] Thatcher’s policies continue to influence
the politics of today, contributing to despair and fear in large parts
of society, especially among those who are oppressed, exploited and
living in precarious situations created by unstable jobs and incomes.
That is the idea of *no alternative* sharply portends *a future without
hope for change*.

## **Community Dilemmas **

The growth of global corporations, especially the impressive
achievements of high-tech corporations, has confirmed that *capitalism*
is the *outstanding economic system*. These developments are intended to
fill up society with the optimistic globalist flows associated with new
techno-capitalist economies. Making a profit on digital platforms and AI
technology has become the key method in the day and age. However, the
broad influences, and the profound impacts of multinational technology
conglomerates, also raise various questions about the operation of a
market economy connected with superpower ownership or monopolistic
competition. Ensuring social justice in a free, growing economy is
becoming a challenge for contemporary societies. The feeling of *being
lost* and *confused* in the matrix of the digital economy intertwined
with *faith* and *fears* towards new technology generated a *global
sense of dilemma* within societies.

To a certain extent, technological optimism is considered a general
attitude in present society. At minimum, this perspective is reflected
widely in mass media. Promoting technological achievements on news,
radio shows, TV programs and YouTube channels is a familiar content. The
economic policies and social action programs in various countries have
special priorities for scientific and technological development.
Techno-optimism has a tendency to rather emphasize the benefits than the
drawbacks of technology to society. There is a common perception that
human progress is achieved through overcoming obstacles. Life regularly
raises various problems, questions, and mysteries; people need to find
ways to solve them or reduce the consequences of those problems. From
the invention of the wheel to the internet, technology is believed to
have helped people to overcome ample obstacles or limitations.
Scientific discoveries are considered to have made human life easier;
technology is the promised potential drive for the development and
progress of society.

Techno-optimism often criticizes Hollywood dystopian tragedies and
argues that those are exaggerated fantasies. The society that will be
decimated and destroyed by the rise of robots is an exaggeration; it is
an attractive dramaturgical trick of film productions.[^5] Meanwhile,
optimists strongly believe in the union of man and machine. They are
convinced by all the positive aspects of new-tech such as it may give
‘longer lives, less absolute poverty, fewer life-threatening illness,
\[and\] more equality of opportunity’.[^6] Those are the generally
attributed values to technological developments.

Information technology and the internet are known as great inventions
created to serve people. People are promised to have instant and
unlimited access to all knowledge. This technology is able to make
communication and social connection simpler, cheaper and more
convenient. New technology is believed to have simplified all living
activities, such as payment, scheduling, route finding, translations,
shopping and entertainment. According to Miklos Sarvary - Professor at
Columbia Business School, ‘platforms are creating so much value for
consumers’[^7] globally.

Particularly, it must be admitted that ‘Technology optimism was so
deeply ingrained in the value system and in the beliefs of people in
Silicon Valley’- the birthplace of hundreds of new technological
discoveries every day.[^8]  Technology corporations have spread strong
beliefs about the transcendent world of the future associated with
technological achievements for popular culture with large-scale
marketing and communication strategies. The majority of tech leaders are
constantly propagating the best things that technology will provide,
like ‘We are doing it for everyone’, we ‘solve problems at scale’,
‘empower people’ and ‘make our services cost less and more
connected’.[^9]^,^ [^10]^,^ [^11]^,^ [^12]

In fact, technological optimism is purposefully propagated to maximize
the influence, expand markets, develop manipulation tactics and benefit
businesses. Sundar Pichai - the CEO of Alphabet Inc. and its subsidiary
Google - has emphasized the conglomerate’s ambition by introducing deep
learning technology,

> We've been focused ever more on our core mission of organizing the
> world's information. And we are doing it for everyone. And we approach
> it by applying deep computer science and technical insights to solve
> problems at scale. That approach has served us very, very well; this
> is what has allowed us to scale up seven of our most important
> products and platforms - to over a billion monthly active users each.
> And it's not just the scale at which these products are working, users
> engage with them very heavily*.*[^13]

The worlds *engaging heavily* here means deepening the level of
dependence of the user, a dependency with no way out. For example, let
us imagine someone’s Gmail account suddenly disappeared - that would be
the worst nightmare scenario not only for one single user, but for more
than 1.5 billion people around the world.

The CEO of Microsoft from 2014, Satya Nadella also mentioned: ‘Our
mission simply put is to empower you to create that tech-intensity in
your organization, in your institution, so that you can have a broad,
deep impact on the broader society.’[^14] In addition, Mark Zuckerberg,
co-founder of the social media platform Facebook also made clear his
expansionist ambitions when, in 2021, he changed Facebook's name to
Meta. He stated,

> We want to serve as many people as possible, which means working to
> make our services cost less, not more. Our mobile apps are free. Our
> ads business model is an auction, which guarantees every business the
> most competitive price possible. And it worked. Billions of people
> love our products, we have hundreds of millions of businesses on our
> platform, and we have a rapidly growing ecosystem and a thriving
> business. That’s the approach that we want to take to help build the
> Metaverse, too.[^15]

Techno-optimism has clearly dominated the perceptions of consumers and
tied them to the services and products of the platform. Building loyalty
ties was the strategy of feudalism in the past and performed by
capitalism in the present. *Customer engagement methods* are the core
activities to establish customer loyalty to techno-brands. The *loyalty
business model* is applied widely in digital business management.[^16]
The main goal of this model is to build customer satisfaction that is
the foundation for user loyalty and the basis for customer manipulation.

Based on the number of accounts that big tech platforms possess, the
impact of these platforms is much broader than the influence of the
national government. Billions of people are profiled and governed by
technology corporations. With the *supranational* scale, millions of
social problems have arisen within the platform’s society; however, the
operating apparatus and staff of these corporations have been
continuously simplified, reduced and automatized by intelligent
computing, causing countless social problems that have not yet been
fully solved.

The Arab Spring (2010-2012) is a remarkable example of the
irresponsibility of social media platforms with important political
issues that are deeply impacted by cyber activities.[^17]

With the help of a Facebook page protesting abuses by the regime of
Hosni Mubarak, in just 28 days, the activities of social media activist
teams had led to the fall of the regime. Wael Ghonim, who played a
prominent role in sparking the Egyptian Revolution of the year 2011,
expressed to CNN reporters: ‘I want to meet Mark Zuckerberg one day and
thank him’ shortly after the success of the revolution and the step down
of President Muhammad Hosni Mubarak. But soon later, Ghonim bitterly
said: ‘The hardest part for me was seeing the tool that brought us
together tearing us apart. These tools are just enablers for whomever,
they don't separate between what's good and bad. They just look at
engagement metrics.’[^18] Despite being asked to intervene in
provocative developments that could lead to violence in Egypt, the
Facebook platforms were silent and did not take any action.[^19] Instead
of giving hope to a *digital democracy*, many incitements to violence
from social media have sparked bloody actions in this region. Marc Lynch
of George Washington University stated in a Foreign Policy article,
‘There is something very different about scrolling through pictures and
videos of unified, chanting Yemeni or Egyptian crowds demanding
democratic change and waking up to a gory image of a headless 6-year-old
girl on your Facebook news feed.’[^20]

Inhuman political forces are able to use *technical tricks* to benefit
from inciting violence, intervening in the truth and even interrogating
and torturing their targets since they understand the *operating logic
of algorithms* and the *technological loopholes*. With the ability to
affect others anonymously, various political forces can attack
individuals in numerous ways, such as sending spam or email bomb,
hacking social media accounts or spreading fake news about the targeted
victim.[^21] In cyberspace, we witness an increment in the use of
*cyber-torture* on a global scale. This problem has been alerted by
specific UN reports of professor Nils Melzer in 2020.[^22] States,
organizations, and criminal groups are not only capable of conducting
cyber-operations that cause critical suffering to countless individuals
but do so for the specific purpose of torture. Cybertechnology may also
be used to cause or contribute to severe emotional distress, most
notably through intimidation, bullying, harassment, surveillance, public
shaming, and defamation, as well as appropriation, deletion, or
manipulation of information.[^23]

Revolutionary activists and politicians have complained to Facebook
about *troll factories* contributing to political instability in
different regions of the world, but the silence was the most common
solution by platforms. Another example, the fake news about Ukraine's
political situation spread from Russian troll factories. Dmytro Shymkiv
- a top adviser to Ukraine's president (from 2014 to 2018), met Facebook
representatives and asked them to intervene in the proliferation of fake
news about the Ukraine situation circulating on the Facebook platform.
Shymkiv recounted the response from Facebook: ‘Sorry, we are an open
platform in which anybody can do anything’.[^24] In fact, Facebook did
not care about fake accounts or troll factories that operated on their
platform for a long time.

Fraud and cheating in cyberspace in general, and in social media in
particular, have become a common and out of control problem in many
places, especially in *developing countries* where legislation regarding
technology are still inefficient. For example, various fake accounts
were set up to mimic real users in order to misappropriate money from
their relatives and friends. Scam investment, counterfeit goods
business, and fake services through social networks have become common
issues in developing regions, especially in South East Asia. Live stream
sales have become a high-revenue business phenomenon in Vietnam since
2016. Most sellers will set up sales channels on social platforms,
regularly livestreaming videos introducing real products at attractive
prices. In numerous cases, customers receive counterfeit goods from
these unknown online sales services. These livestream sellers often pay
significant amounts to advertise on such as Facebook, allowing their
live-stream videos to appear on the ‘news feeds’ of target audiences,
even engaging in excess of 10,000 followers.[^25] With the allurement of
liveliness, skillful narration and attractive images, and a series of
fake maneuvers (such as setting up a fake-buyer account system to
interact, post and share), several livesteamers in Vietnam have earned
up to 400,000 euros per month selling *knock-offs* through livestream
methods on the Facebook. [^26]^,^ [^27] Nevertheless, there is a lack of
regulation from both platforms and legal institutions to protect
customers. In the current Vietnamese situation, no one seemingly
controls the quality of the selling products and the trustworthiness of
information in the advertisements on these platforms.

The existence of social problems arising from online advertising does
not detract from the growth of this industry. On the contrary, online
advertising creates new orders in popular culture. The emergence of
digital stars on social network platforms has gradually replaced
classical celebrities. For example, product reviews, tutorials, and
entertaining videos on the Youtube platform have created new form of
stars. YouTube Stars such as MrBeast, Jake Paul, And Markiplier have
reached nearly 90 million YouTube subscribers and earned from 18 million
to 54 million US dollars per year, and nearly half of their earnings
come from the ad revenue. In addition, these stars have branded
merchandise lines that have supported them or help them to make
money.[^28]

There are seemingly 1001 mysteries and business tactics in the operation
of the information technology world. Edward Snowden mentioned:

> The screen may be off as it's sitting on your desk, but the device is
> talking all of the time. The question - we have to ask is who is it
> talking to? Even if your phone is not hacked, right now, you look at
> it, it's just sitting there on the charger. It is talking tens or
> hundreds or thousands of times a minute to any number of different
> companies - who have apps installed on your phone. It looks like it's
> off, it looks like it's just sitting there, but it is constantly
> chattering. And unfortunately, like pollution, we have not created the
> tools that are necessary for ordinary people to be able to see this
> activity.[^29]

Not many are able to understand the complex operating mechanisms inside
the current computational system; in addition, various undisclosed
digital business tactics drive *technological mysteries* to go further.
Although the new technological terms such as artificial intelligence,
machine learning, deep learning, Big Data, Internet of Things, and cloud
computing are mentioned quite often in public media, the majority of
ordinary customers are still far from knowing what exactly they are, how
they work, and how they affect each user. With self-learning and
self-making decision abilities, the performance of present AI systems
even goes beyond human understanding capabilities.[^30] The recent open
letter with signatures from hundreds of the biggest names in the
technology scene, including Elon Musk, has urged the world’s leading
artificial intelligence labs to take a break in training new
super-powerful systems for six months.[^31] The letter pointed out that

> Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life
> on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with commensurate care
> and resources\[…\] Unfortunately, this level of planning and
> management is not happening, even though recent months have seen AI
> labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more
> powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can
> understand, predict, or reliably control.[^32]

Moreover, the invisible strategy plans of tech-owners worsen the
mysterious situation related to new-techs. According to Frank Pasquale,
while technology has deeply pushed us into ‘the black box society’,
where ‘powerful businesses, financial institutions, and government
agencies hide their actions behind nondisclosure agreements,
‘proprietary methods’, and gag rules, our own lives are increasingly
open books’.[^33] For example, how do data broker companies collect
information, where do they store it, how do they use the user's data,
and for what? Those questions are the ‘obvious mysteries’ in our
contemporary society. The mystery of the technology world might be one
of the special arguments for the common *feelings of faith and fear* in
new tech of users.

Martin Heidegger noted in the book *The Question Concerning Technology*
that the modern people create an almost unscientific worship of
science.[^34] We seem to be overwhelmed by the ideas of efficiency and
productivity related to technological achievements. Without awareness of
the actual underground problems of new technology, the achievements of
science may dangerously slip out of the public's control. Technology is
not a mere instrument, it is not a mere neutral tool. It is created by
humans and serves firstly serves human purpose to the benefit of its
creators.[^35] It is certainly true that the majority of present
technology research centers, the birthplace of new inventions and
applications, require a huge amount of capital to maintain research and
experimental activities. The largest technology research centers in the
world belong to or are sponsored by private corporations. States aim to
gradually reduce public expenditures, and public finances are
withdrawing from investment in research centers.[^36] This drives a high
concentration of private ownership of technology research centres
globally. Hence, most current tech creations are from the orders of
investors and aimed at serving corporations. In several cases, as with
the US and China, developed countries could invest in technology
research, although this may not be any different since most
technological inventions serve the purposes of the ruling parties.

If the interests of the public are disregarded or even appropriated,
technological achievements cannot obtain the promised values of tech
owners. The *worship of technology* is rooted in the *public's fear and
over-optimism* in tech achievements considered scientific truths. These
truths are manmade results which reflect the mentality of a certain
phase of time. Scientific records or conclusions can change according to
the consensus of society at certain periods, as the American physicist
and philosopher Thomas Kuhn demonstrated for a series of *paradigm
shifts* in the history of human science.[^37] Therefore, scientific
optimism is a relative belief and we should perceive tech achievements
as transitory developments. Moreover, there are various scientific
conclusions that are manipulated and dominated by investors, the reason
why the promised technological value or *current scientific truths*
should always be taken into the consideration.

Taking a closer look at the reality of information technology abilities
in the two years 2020 and 2021, at the peak of the *COVID-19 pandemic,*
we see the *gains and losses* in the experimental period on the highly
focused technology driven society. In the emergency context, plenty of
incomplete and even potential risky technologies were still in use.
Governments, organizations, education committees, and businesses
normally spend years making decisions, but during the pandemic, they
decided to apply new technology within a few hours. The most common
defense was that inaction would result in greater damage. There are
intertwined pros and cons, advantages and challenges, and beliefs and
concerns regarding technology throughout the pandemic.

In the early stages of the pandemic, with daily reports of severe
illness and high mortality, people feared that the science of the day
was powerless against the forces of nature. However, reality has shown
that humans are not helpless; pandemics are not uncontrollable. While
the virus can breed in and spread from the wild, science and technology
have made global epidemics a manageable challenge.[^38] From first
reports about a potential pandemic at the end of December 2019 to
January 10, 2020, scientists had not only isolated the responsible virus
but also sequenced its genome and published the information online.
During the subsequent few months, health organizations introduced
measures that would slow and stop the chains of infection. Several
effective vaccines were placed in production in less than a year. In
early 2021, COVID-19 vaccines were introduced into expanded vaccination
programs in many countries. The world has never witnessed such a rapid
response to a new pathogen. Although there were complaints about the
side effects and sequelae of vaccines, one cannot deny the magic of
science and technology that has brought people out of the dark-dead days
of 2020 and 2021.

There were times when social communication had to entirely switch to
cyberspace when the lockdown commands had been implemented in different
areas. Many people had to work from home and communicate exclusively
online for more than a year. Most universities and schools offered
online classes in the same period. Information technology has proven its
role in connecting communities, ensuring jobs and incomes for many
employees who could switch to home office, maintaining the operation of
organizations and businesses, and continuing their classes, training
programs, and sociocultural activities.

New jobs on online platforms were born or developed during the pandemic
period. The reduction of direct personnel due to the avoidance of mass
infection sped up automated activities, such as automatic payment,
shipment and check-in. To continue business activities in a situation of
personnel instability, many companies invested in automatic machines to
replace humans. In various fields, automation proved its efficiency; for
example, with only 1.5% of personnel working directly on farms, the U.S.
still provided enough domestic food, even becoming a leader in
agricultural exports.[^39] Another example, China has taken online
shopping to a new level of development during the pandemic. With the
unprecedented blooming of online sales, forecasting the future of
e-commerce will profoundly affect our lifes. Automation will likely lead
to job replacement, and fears of unemployment will persist alongside
optimism about a future where people will be deprived of work.

Furthermore, the advantage of connectivity has also been accompanied by
limitation of online activity, especially when physical contacts were
almost completely eliminated due to the epidemic. International
conferences, for instance, can be conducted across continents in a
low-cost online format and still spread knowledge to many people, while
elementary school students have struggled with their families and
teachers with online learning and contactless education. The decrease in
the quality of education during online semesters has been recognized
widely in compulsory education schools or even in Universities. Online
art exhibitions, live music shows on YouTube channels, or virtual
museums seem to be only temporary compensation for the cultural needs of
the population. Enjoying culture through these online mediums can hardly
replace real artistic sensational feelings for audiences. In addition,
living in forced isolated situations has increased the level of
depression and mental crisis for many individuals. The lack of physical
connection has obviously created significant mental harm to society.

In addition, there are potential risks in the forms of high-tech
surveillance of the population first examined and applied on a large
scale in many countries during the Covid period. The applications for
personal biological reports, security cameras, and facial recognition
systems used for surveillance of the public in many countries,
especially in China. By monitoring smartphones, using millions of
cameras to identify people in public, and requiring people to declare
their personal medical status, authorities could efficiently identify
suspected Covid-19 cases and trace their movements and potential
contacts whom they may have exposed. A series of mobile apps had also
been deployed to alert people about the infected cases.[^40] Similar
surveillance technologies were also applied in East Asian countries,
Vietnam, and even Israel – when the government used *specialized*
anti-terrorist technologies to monitor patients infected with
Covid-19.[^41]

In addition to the demographic, behavioral, and psychological data
collected in cyberspace before, biometric data has also become an
important target for governing during the pandemic. An individual's body
temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and medical history are
compulsorily collected in many places, stored, and used without
individual consent. When people have to choose between privacy and
health, they have a tendency to prioritize *health*, which is the reason
why personal information was considered less important during the
pandemic. People found themselves in situation where they had to select
one of the twol; however, they should have access to both privacy and
health. People have the right to request that their information be used
only to help them prevent or cure diseases; at the same time, their
information should not be a data product that serves other political or
business purposes.

Regarding high-tech surveillance, people tend to regard technology as a
tool that assists the government to monitor the public; however, in
fact, technology can also help individuals to monitor their governments.
While there is only one-way surveillance, from top to bottom, there is
potential for totalitarian government. Therefore, it is necessary to
reinforce individual supervision toward governments and large
corporations. For example, during the pandemic crisis, governments were
generating revenue and spending large amounts of financial resources.
The process of allocating various types of funds could have been handled
in a more transparent way. In a transparent environment, citizens would
have access to a range of information regarding decision-making
strategies, distribution of services, and expenditures of public funds.
They should have the right to control public money and make certain it
is not misappropriated in corrupt ways. However, the actual COVID
situation went in different a direction. In Vietnam, for example,
monitoring the roll-out of COVID-19 prevention and control services had
little transparency, leading to serious problems in use of fake testing
kits. This led to the resignation of the President, an unprecedented
event, and two Deputy Prime Ministers, and to the dismissal of the
Minister of Health and three Deputy Ministers.[^42] Additionally, in
2022, various companies in Vietnam were criminally prosecuted. Hence,
*surveillance* should be balanced by a *counter-surveillance*, and the
pandemic context was the best testing environment for citizens in many
countries over the world.

An extraordinary situation like the pandemic is a unique rehearsal of a
potential social form, in which digital technology is applied in almost
every aspect of social activities. In other words, this historical event
is a special case study for analyzing the current cyber circumstances
and verifying the future speculations of a human society in which
technology maximizes its role.

Technology has changed the world, supported people to *overcome
obstacles and challenges*, and helped people solve mysteries. However,
people also face various *consequences and problems* arising with the
application of various technologies. Behind artificial intelligence
technology, Big Data, the Internet of Things and Cloud computing there
are a series of *environmental problems*. For instance, to make the
global internet connection system work, an enormous amount of
electricity is needed to feed the server farms, data centres, network
infrastructure, fibre optic systems surrounding the earth, and
electronic devices. One single Google search consumes the same amount of
energy as a standard LED light bulb in use for three minutes, and if one
considers the number of Google searches requested in a typical day, week
and year, multiplied by the number of half the world's population, the
sum is extraordinary.[^43] Moreover, to run the entire digital industry,
rare-earth metals such as lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, samarium,
europium, terbium, and dysprosium have been mined exhaustively for the
hardware manufacturing industry. Cobalt mining for lithium-ion batteries
is a special example that raises concerns about environmental
devastation in Congo.[^44] On the one hand, digital technology created a
simple and easy environment to connect people; on the other hand, it
also pushed different social communities into various political,
economic, cultural, and environmental crises.

Advanced computational technology contributed to the expansion of living
space, and cyberspace became a new land for many individuals, offering
new job opportunities, new study methods and new ways of entertaining.
The optimism about an economy driven by technology, a future of
*accelerated product commercialization*, and the efficient sales and
delivery models of *programmatic advertising*, is accompanied by worries
and doubts about *excessive stress*, the *loss of identity*, *private
rights*, and the *right to self-decision making*.

New digital technology introduces contemporary people to utility worlds
and the unprecedented intimate relationship between machines and humans.
Face ID keeps users logged in on devices and apps, avoiding wasting time
for multiple log-in activities, and that is how customers are
maintaining a continuous digital profile and their active digital life
in cyberspace. All user needs are recognized and responded to instantly
by platforms. Virtual assistants are continuously there - in the car, in
the house, in the pockets of numberless users to follow them, listen to
their confidences and wish them goodnight daily. Is one able to forego
the convenience and intimacy inherent in the technological world? One
typical concern in communities is how ubiquitous monitoring of personal
information deprives the user of control. The lack of transparency in
the use of technology is a common phenomena. However, customers have a
tendency to *ignore the drawbacks* and *accept the manipulated
situation* created by tech owners, particularly through advertisements
and propaganda messages, in exchange to use the free services and
products of the platforms. Should people require both tech benefits and
human rights? How can we solve the *tech dilemma* in the contemporary
societies?

The ideological pressures of being unable to find solutions to social
problems, and the idea that ‘There is no alternative’ have led a large
part of our society to *nihilism* and the tendency to *normalize all
problems in life*. As Jean Baudrillard wrote:

> The apocalypse is finished, today it is the precession of the neutral,
> of forms of the neutral and of indifference \[...\] all that remains,
> is the fascination for desert like and indifferent forms, for the very
> operation of the system that annihilates us. Now, fascination (in
> contrast to seduction, which was attached to appearances, and to
> dialectical reason, which was attached to meaning) is a nihilistic
> passion par excellence, it is the passion proper to the mode of
> disappearance. We are fascinated by all forms of disappearance, of our
> disappearance. Melancholic and fascinated, that is our general
> condition in an era of involuntary transparency.[^45]

A universal sense of *helplessness* and *impotency* of ordinary people
contributed to the capitalist advantages. In developing countries in
East Asia especially, nihilism and hyper normalization are deepening. As
a fundamental part of Buddhist philosophy, renunciation is the method to
end suffering. The culmination of the path that the Buddha taught was
nirvana, ‘a place of nothingness \[…\] non-possession and \[…\]
non-attachment \[…\] which is the total end of death and decay.’[^46]
Therefore, there is a common attitude of distancing reality and leaving
the current situation to occur according to the nature of the outside
world. Each individual is advised to bring an end to suffering by
*self-cultivation*. These ideas have contributed actively to the
weakening of revolutionary ideas and criticism. In addition, the fear of
change deeply rooted in the attitude of the postwar generations made
them feel threatened by disillusionment with the aftermath of these
revolutions. They are seeking stability that condititions them to accept
social repression and unfairness. A major part of contemporary societies
is facing the reality of hyper normalization.

All in all, in communities where everyone is frightened of change, it is
that fear of change that actually feeds the power. In this day and age,
in various places, people are forced to believe that ‘There is no
alternative’.[^47]

## **Finding The Way In The Digital Maze**

New computing technologies have brought both faith and fear,
satisfaction and anxiety to society. The previous parts of this study
attempted to depict the complex reality of the political economy, and to
analyse different social problems that have emerged in the age of
artificial intelligence and automation. Instead of falling into
confusion, disorientation, and neglectfulness, people should cross over
the ideological crisis after the postmodern period and, as Luke Turner
suggested in his *Metamodernist Manifesto,* go beyond ‘irony and
sincerity, naivety and knowingness, relativism and truth, optimism and
doubt, \[…\] we must go forth and oscillate!’.[^48] By concrete acts of
resistance and struggle, we can make changes, find new alternatives,
rebuild more sustainable values, and sustain the existence of humanity.
Though we know that ‘The revolutions are brutal, and this is the thing
that one has to go back to if you want change. If you really want to
change the world, you have to tackle power.’[^49]

To make real change, we must revolutionize in different ways our methods
and media; aside from the individual ones, collective actions are
critical. In addition to guiding users to fair attitudes and lifestyles
in cyberspace, we require a real change from legislators and executives
and accurate actions from governments regarding the emerging issues in
cyberspace. We may need to include radical acts, to force technology
corporations to listen and communicate about existing issues, and soften
the influence of consumerism on social culture. For more than a decade,
many scientists, philosophers, sociologists, computer scientists,
activists, and journalists have been active in discussing, making
proposals, as well as participating in various social projects to
respond to these social issues.

Writing about the influence of social media, Jaron Lanier, a
technologist, futurist, computer philosopher and a founder of the field
of virtual reality, offers arguments for abandoning social media.[^50]
He expresses how reliance on social media platforms reduces the capacity
for spirituality and that users become automated extensions of the
platforms. Examples revealed in his narrative show how users of Twitter
and Facebook have become cruder, more tribal and less empathetic.[^51]

In an earlier book, *Who Owns the Future*?[^52] Lanier argues that the
middle class is disenfranchised from online economies. By convincing
users to provide personal information in exchange for free services,
companies are able to accumulate large amounts of data at no cost. He
called these companies *Siren Servers*, a reference to the Sirens of
Ulysses. Rather than paying individuals for their contributions to the
data pool, Siren Servers concentrates wealth in the hands of people who
control the data center. As one solution to these problems, Lanier puts
forth an alternative structure to the web based on Ted Nelson's Project
Xanadu. He proposes a two-way linking system that would point to the
source of any piece of information, generating an economy of
micropayments that compensates online customers for original material
posted to the web.

In addition to Lanier, other leaders in the tech world have stepped out
of senior positions to focus on social change endeavors. Included among
them are: Tristan Harris - director and co-founder of the Center for
Humane Technology, Timnit Gebru- a computer scientist who run the
Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR), Meredith
Whittaker - President of the Signal Foundation, director of the AI Now
Institute, Joy Buolamwini - computer scientist and digital activist
based at the MIT Media Lab, etc,.[^53]^,^ [^54]^,^ [^55]

They directly or indirectly became social activists. They have a
profound contribution in responding to the social implications of
artificial intelligence and related technologies. Although it is
difficult to compare with the powerful acts of the technological,
economic and political forces, these acts of resistance to the
opposition have attracted great public attention and prepared the stage
for a new development with much more consideration for human and moral
values.

In 2019, innovative ideas for the 5^th^ Industrial Revolution were
proposed by Pratik Gauri & Jim Van Eerden.[^56] They provided a
humanistic vision for the evolution of industrial revolutions and a
continuation of the 4^th^ industrial revolution.

The first revolution began with the emergence of steam engines; the
second revolution was characterized by the iron and steel, oil,
electricity, and internal combustion engine industries; the third was
the digital revolution that exploded with the advent of personal
computers and the internet; the fourth revolution was notable for
advances in a series of automation technologies, super artificial
intelligent machines capable of self-learning, automated communication,
stratified data analysis based on Big data and IoT. The fifth industrial
revolution is predicted to be a combination of machines and humans
wherein advanced technology is formulated based on ethics, humanity, and
social responsibility to solve the existing limitations of previous
revolutions.

Broadly, the innovation associated with social responsibility or
*sustainable development* has become a main concern to the international
community in recent years. It is clearly expressed in the *Sustainable
Development Goals* (The Sustainable Development Goals - SDGs) of the
United Nations Security General Assembly in in 2015, a set of 17
interlinked global goals designed to be a ‘blueprint for achieving a
better and more sustainable future for all’.[^57] The target for
achieving the 17 SDGs is 2030.

Therefore, social development associated with technology today must be
linked to sustainable development goals. In the digital environment,
especially, morals and humanity, social inequality, the digital divide,
responsible consumption and production should be the principal focus of
all development.

Issues related to the ethics of AI and its decentralization have become
emerging concerns in international forums where sustainable development
based on technology is paramount. There are remarkable contemporary
concerns indicated in the book *The Oxford Handbook of Ethics of AI*
published by Oxford University Press in 2020.[^58] This book maps
sharply the current production, application, and use of artificial
intelligence in diverse spheres of individual, commercial, social, and
public life by an interdisciplinary and transcontinental academic
community. This handbook presents various approaches to the *Ethics of
AI* conundrum. Nevertheless, the closest approach to the scope of this
study is *human ethics toward AI*.

Since AI driven machines are entities capable of self-learning, self
decision making, and even capable of expressing emotions, how will we
relate to these machines? Should we treat them more like humans, or
rather like animals? Should AI and machines have any moral status? With
the posthuman approach, especially, these questions are among the main
considerations. There are also countless issues generated through these
questions. For example, should self-driving cars using AI be considered
ethical agents? What kind of ethical competence should these AI machine
have? How should AI be treated vis a vis moral status? Is artificial
intelligence *just a machine*? Does it deserve ethical consideration?
Should we treat it differently from a dishwasher or refrigerator? Should
we just *unplug* and *kill* the machine when it poses a potential risk?
According to the philosopher of technology, Mark Coeckelbergh, ‘Some
argue that *mistreating* an AI is wrong not because any harm is done to
the AI, but because our moral character is damaged if we do so.’[^59] In
another way, morality is a human idea and is about our attitudes.

Conventionally, human attitudes in a community are very
multidimensional, and problems of bias, discrimination, and inequality
have always been present in society. However, AI–with its potential for
impact–is predicted to perpetuate these problems and deepen their
impact. Therefore, the early prognosis and actions to prevent profound
social effects of AI technology are an essential responsibility of
contemporary society, before it is too late. Above all, the programmers,
who produce and apply AI, need to have the right ethical attitude
regarding the products they create, and be aware of the negative effects
and possible consequences of technology. As Fei-Fei Li, a senior
computer scientist in AI and computer vision, reminded technology
engineers: ‘There's nothing artificial about AI. It's inspired and
created by people, and most importantly it impacts people. It is a
powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a
profound responsibility.’[^60]

In addition, through explicit policies related to AI ethics, various
social issues can be adjusted in time. Currently, the rapid growth of
AI-generated art has left many artists concerned about a technologically
advanced form of plagiarism. In early 2023, a group of San Francisco
artists are taking legal action to reclaim copyright and consent by
filing a class-action lawsuit against DreamUp, Midjourney, and Stable
Diffusion.[^61] They have discovered that an open-source AI-based
image-generating tool called Disco Diffusion was using the work of many
artists without their knowledge or consent. Similar issues need to be
clarified and resolved in the context of legal regulations.

The transparency of AI and related new technology, in fact, has already
been discussed to some extent in legislative bodies of several developed
countries such as the US and the European Union. Examples of specific
topics such as *Optimizing for Engagement: Understanding the Use of
Persuasive Technology on Internet Platforms and The Risk of Manipulation
and Deception in the Digital Age* have been discussed in the United
States Senate and House Of Representatives in the years 2019 and
2020.[^62] In April 2021, the EU Commission presented the *AI Issue
Package*, including *Communication on Fostering a European Approach to
AI*; a review of the *Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence* (with
EU Member States); and the proposal for a regulation laying down
harmonized rules on AI (AI Act) and relevant Impact assessment.[^63]
These are considered the first actions for policies related to new
technology issues and AI.

However, there are plentiful complicated issues and obstacles in policy
decision-making process related to AI. Firstly, the rapid development of
technology and its complex applications create elusive limits for the
*lawmakers.* Secondly, the involment of multiple factors makes it
difficult to attribute *responsibility* for the *rising problems*.
Thirdly, there is the limitation of conflictuous views on *justice and
fairness*. For example, creating a positive action toward disadvantaged
individuals or groups remains controversial. Should justice be blind and
unbiased, and, therefore, should algorithms be blind to race, or is
justice meant to create an advantage for those who are already
marginalized, thus leading to bias and discrimination? And should policy
in a democratic context prioritize protecting the interests of the
majority or focus on the interests of minorities?[^64] Therefore, in a
new technologically influenced environment, there must be a continuous
improvement of the legal framework and a common consensus on the ethical
views on new technology, especially regarding AI ethics. The concepts of
justice and democracy should be considered case-by-case and implemented
in a particular context.

Moreover, to limit monopoly control and create opportunities for
democratic dialogue and build equality of rights in cyberspace, society
needs to promote decentralized AI, decentralized social media, and
decentralized public media. Regaining control of the internet and
digital infrastructure is an important task ahead because it is the
basic infrastructure of 21^st^-century society.[^65] In addition, it is
necessary to activate policies that encourage and create conditions for
small technology research centers, protect the interests of start-ups,
limit the manipulative power of corporations, raise awareness against
the exploitation in cyberspace, fight for the rights of users, and
introduce and apply alternative trustful products and services. These
are the initial practical actions aimed at *decolonizing cyberspace*,
which reduces and eliminates the influence of supranational platforms
presently holding the overall control over the future of AI.[^66]

CryptoParties are forms of decentralized initiatives that gained
prominence in the global online community in recent times; by joing this
movement, users are able to learn how to improve their digital privacy
and security.[^67] CryptoParties introduce basic cryptography tools–such
as the Tor anonymity network, public key encryption (PGP/GPG), and OTR
(Off The Record messaging) - to the general public. There is a
CryptoParty handbook–an open source document downloadable for free on
many forums. Readers are able to access useful information such as tips
for using email safely, how to prevent tracking when using browsers, how
to keep passwords safe, and how to safely circulate files on the
network, a wide range of alternative applications with open-source codes
are introduced.

Taking action on the copyright issues related to AI-generated art tools,
a team at the University of Chicago introduced a free-to-use *Glaze*
software in March 2023 to help protect original artworks.[^68] A layer
of data invisible to the human eye has been added over images that *acts
as a decoy* for AI. Theoretically, if generative AI encounters an image
that has been protected by Glaze, it will be unable to accurately
analyze and replicate its style.

In addition to the mentioned micro solutions, researchers and
policymakers are interested in solutions at the macro level–predicting
or forming new social paradigm scenarios. In the book *Superminds: How
Hyperconnectivity is Changing the Way We Solve Problems,* Thomas W.
Malone outlined a vision of a *cyber‐socialism* in which he points to
the social credit system that China has placed in trial applications in
recent decades as an example. [^69]^,^ [^70] By connecting it to the
false legacies of historical socialism, he highlights that the problems
of information technology controlled *social credit system* are being
reproduced in Chinese experimental version. For example, there is a
widespread deprivation of privacy; personal data is exposed to the
public and manipulated by social regulators; individuals live without
private ownership; all aspects of life are assessed through social value
scales and ranking; and reputation and social contribution are the
social measurement tools. It is a dystopian scenario of IT-enabled
socialistic decision-making that Thomas W. Malone is trying to connect
with the idea of cyber-socialism. Meanwhile, we continue to witness the
loss of personal data, the loss of self-determination, the misleading
value through rankings and ratings, and personal reputation within the
IT products of the contemporary capitalist economic system.

Malone’s model is not the only form of cyber socialism that the world
could follow; the socialistic decision-making models of Nordic countries
such as Estonia could be mentioned as well.[^71] Another proposal
towards the collectivization of ownership of social capital with
emphasis on technological capital is introduced in the work *Inhuman
Power - Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Capitalism.* Authors
Nick Dyer-Witheford, Atle Mikkola Kjøsen, and James Steinhoff have made
in-depth analyses of the ownership of AI capital, forecasting that AI
will entirly unmake the old modes of productions, and automated methods
will gradually take over the full economic system. The authors also
mention as a suggestion:

> A communist orientation to AI takes as its priority neither halting AI
> (Luddism) nor intensifying its development (accelerationism) but
> rather liquidating the structural dynamics of capital that have so far
> fostered its development \[…\] the most promising parts of
> postcapitalist/left-accelerationist programmes are not those that
> advance the automation of work within capital, but rather those that
> point to the expropriation of AI-capital, the development of new forms
> of *collective ownership of AI*, and the application of AI to the
> collectivization of other sectors.[^72]

They also believe that if realized the ‘fully automated luxury
communism, or postcapitalism, envisages a transition to socialism by
reducing or eliminating the need to work and supplying a universal basic
income.’[^73] However, *Inhuman Power* also recognizes the limitations
and difficult realities of achieving a model of technological communism.
In conclusion, they wrote ‘AI-capital is an abyss, communism a bridge
across, but a perilous, shaky one, partially in flames, and with an
obscured arrival point on the other side: nonetheless, advance.’[^74]

John Perry Barlow, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation
(EFF), published *A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace*
(1996) in which he states, ‘These increasingly hostile and colonial
measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of
freedom and self-determination who had to reject the authorities of
distant, uninformed powers. We must declare our virtual selves immune to
your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent to your rule over our
bodies.’[^75] Technology will continue to be developed and applied
following human existence, in order to to be a means of support, serving
the common interests of all people. Technology should not be a tool of
exploitation, oppression and manipulation by a small group. On a global
level, contemporary society must take action, even radical revolutions,
to achieve synchronous management of evolving technological issues.

## **Artistic Warriors**

In *Artistic Warriors*, the narrative weaves through the rich tapestry
of human ingenuity, emphasizing our innate role as designers of both our
environments and fates. As a species, we employ structured methodologies
not just in the creation of tangible objects but in every facet of our
existence—from shaping social systems to scripting personal
interactions.[^76] The act of design, deeply embedded in our survival
instincts, has evolved from primitive shelter construction to the
sophisticated orchestration of modern societies. Throughout history,
every sentence formulated, every shelter erected, and every garment
crafted is a testament to our relentless experimentation and adaptation.
Today, our scope has broadened; we design not only the physical but the
abstract, influencing social constructs and even the design processes
themselves.[^77] This story reflects on how these multifaceted design
activities are not just acts of creation but powerful tools for
reshaping our postcolonial reality, challenging the remnants of imposed
structures and envisioning a world where design serves as a conduit for
liberation and transformation.

Currently, it's essential to view design phenomena through the lens of
their interactions among traditional design disciplines and other
fields. Many modern design endeavors integrate various art forms and
social activities, encompassing graphic design, web design, filmmaking,
and even social movements like protests and occupations, as well as
legal actions. Both art and design serve as potent mediums that
articulate creators' visions, ideas, and intentions, while also
addressing everyday human needs. The relationship between art and life
has been tightened throughout human history. Expanding the idea of art
seems inevitable since social complexity is an obvious fact. Art
increasingly requires its own involvement in questioning and answering
for reality as well as liberating the artist from social limitations. As
Guy Debord wrote in *Internationale Situationist (Paris), No. 1, June
1958*: ‘Art need no longer be an account of past sensations. It can
become the direct organization of more highly evolved sensations. It is
a question of producing ourselves, not things that enslave us.’[^78]

Facing social problems, artists, designers and creative workers make a
significant contribution together with other field practitioners by
drawing social attention to the emergent issues; they are the active
agents for social change. Design deals with multiple tasks; it is no
longer just a means to solve a single problem, a tool to create
commercial products, but it is also a mechanism to understand society as
a whole, a tool for manifesting, criticizing, negotiating, educating and
prototyping the future of human beings. We can consider the most
explicit social form of art. Taking the classical design processes, the
contemporary design projects regularly show a blend of imagination,
research, planning, experimentation, and decision-making to produce the
design results. Indeed, this is the reason why research-based methods
are a remarkable characteristic of design practice.

In general, there are numerous social issues that have occurred among
various design interest topics, from those related to democracy,
autonomy, equality, feminism, and colonization, to consumption, trade,
environment, and medicine. Contemporary design has several common
approaches to problems, such as the depiction, evaluation and criticism
of the current situation, proposal, test, and practice solutions to
create positive social changes and increase social benefits.

Currently, the major part of socially engaged contemporary design works
focuses on depicting, evaluating, and critiquing reality and
experimenting and practicing micro-solutions. However, the need for
macro-solutions has become more and more significant, since many social
problems cannot be solved without systemic change. As Walter Benjamin
elaborates in his article *The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical
Reproduction*

> The transformation of the superstructure, which takes place far more
> slowly than that of the substructure, has taken more than half a
> century to manifest in all areas of culture the change in the
> conditions of production. Only today can it be indicated what form
> this has taken. Certain prognostic requirements should be met by these
> statements. However, theses about the art of the proletariat after its
> assumption of power or about the art of a classless society would have
> less bearing on these demands than theses about the developmental
> tendencies of art under present conditions of production. Their
> dialectic is no less noticeable in the superstructure than in the
> economy. It would therefore be wrong to underestimate the value of
> such theses as a weapon \[...\] They are useful for the formulation of
> revolutionary demands in the politics of art.[^79]

By embracing political action and social involvement, Social Design,
Critical Design, and Design Activism are typical *design activities*
most associated with social issues in recent years. These design
practices initially belonged to the counter-design movement, alternative
dialogue methods with various power forms; currently, these practices
have gained a positive impact on the design mainstream. These socially
oriented design dialogues have demonstrated globally the efforts of
artists, designers, and creators. In particular, sustainable design is
highlighted in the present design world. To briefly depict the picture
of socially engaged contemporary social designs, the following part of
this writing will introduce several related examples of exhibitions, art
projects, artworks and art activities.

*Design and the Just City* - Harvard Graduate School of Design, at AIA’s
Center for Architecture, USA 2018.[^80] The exhibition focused on how
design and planning contribute to equitable and unjust conditions in
cities, neighbourhoods, and public areas and asks whether design can
have an impact on correcting urban injustices, inequalities, and
disparities.

*Social Design* at Museum für Gestaltung, Zürich, Germany 2019.[^81] The
exhibition aimed to confront the rapidly growing imbalance of resources,
means of production, and future opportunities. Solutions were considered
relying on the new, equitable exchange between individuals, civil
society, the state, and the economy. Given that condition, many
architects, designers, handicraftsmen, and engineers all developed
various solutions through their works.

2020.[^82] The Asia Social Design Expo featured more than a hundred the
global social design units from 20 countries and regions. The exhibition
theme included circular economy, disaster response, educational
diversity, minority care, and urban innovation. The exhibition
introduced the ways design energy solves social issues and creates a
better society.

mediators. The exhibited works were persuasive objects that actively
demonstrate their role in building a better society.

*Critical Design*

*Evidence Dolls* - Dunne & Raby was one of the artworks shown in the
‘No. 15 Designing Critical Design’at Z33 House for Contemporary Art,
Design and Architecture, Belgium 2007.[^84] This was an early critical
design exhibition. The exhibited designers distanced themselves from the
modern world of commercial design but they still use the mechanisms of
that very world to question the discipline and technology, social and
ethical questions.

Figure S5. 8: Design and the Elastic Mind ©moma.org.

*Design and the Elastic Mind*at MoMA, New York, USA, 2008.[^85] The
exhibition focused on momentous technology changes, science, and social
mores. These changes were supposed to require major adjustments in human
behavior and turn them into objects and systems that people understand
and use. The exhibition included objects, projects, and concepts offered
by teams of designers, scientists, and engineers over the world. It
ranged in scale from nanodevices to vehicles, from appliances to
interfaces, and from pragmatic solutions for everyday use to provocative
ideas meant to influence people future choices.

*Design activism and artistic activism*

In addition to peaceful critical design or contributed social design, we
also witness more radical design actions from tactical media and
collective art. Design activism, also known as artistic activism, is a
practice method with resistant actions such as protest, hacking, and
occupying, in which graphic design is an early active involved form.
With the traditional propaganda functions, graphic works are considered
an important design form in initial artistic activism projects.

Disarmament, 1958. ©shillingtoneducation.com.[^86]

Tactical media is a specific example of using interdisciplinary methods
in art activist action. In tactical media projects, the role of art is
emphasized.[^87] Some prominent representatives of tactical media
practice include The Yes Men, Critical Art Ensemble, and RTMark. The
majority of tactical media projects include the use of design as a tool
to denote resistance scenarios.

The Yes Men are a duo of culture-jamming activists and supporters
network founded by Jacques Servin and Igor Vamos.[^88] One of the most
famous jokes of The Yes Men was to put a *corrected* World Trade
Organization (WTO) website at http://www.gatt.org (General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade).[^89] The fake website began receiving real emails
from confused visitors, including invitations to address various elite
groups on behalf of the WTO, and they responded as if they were the real
WTO.[^90] At the WTO, in October 2000, the Yes Men gave speeches
encouraging corporations to buy votes directly from residents. They then
started a performative action, introducing a gold spandex body suit
implanted with sensors. They declared that the wearing of this suit
would improve worker productivity since managers would no longer need to
personally oversee workers but could track them via screen images and
the implanted sensors.

The Critical Art Ensemble (CAE) is another collective of five tactical
media practitioners from many disciplines, including computer graphics
and web design, film/video, photography, text arts, book arts, and
performance.[^91] The collective has written seven books and their works
have been translated into 18 languages. Their books include: The
Electronic Disturbance (1994), Electronic Civil Disobedience & Other
Unpopular Ideas (1996), Flesh Machine: Cyborgs, Designer Babies, & New
Eugenic Consciousness (1998), Digital Resistance: Explorations in
Tactical Media (2001), Molecular Invasion (2002), Marching Plague
(2006), and the project book Disturbances (2012). Regarding the topic of
their activities, in the 1990s, CAE mainly focused on projects related
to the interrogation of biotechnology; since 2006, they have changed the
focus of their work towards a critique of US defence policy.[^92]

RTMark is a notable anti-consumerist activist collective whose main
focus is to break the *Corporate Shield* that is *protecting* American
corporations.[^93] RTMark is a registered company that brings together
activists who plan projects with sponsors who fund them. As a result, it
operates outside the laws governing individual human beings and benefits
from laws governing much looser corporations. RTMark claims their first
prank was the *Barbie Liberation Organization* in 1993.[^94]

*Act of designing in the age of AI and automation*

Reacting to new technological challenges, especially the rapid
development of machine learning and automation, there are significant
contributions of designers and art creators. In addition to applying AI
as an aid to design and the making of art, some artists have considered
AI and automation as a social phenomena, using design and art to
interrogate, criticize, and offer solutions.

*Face to Facebook* by Paolo Cirio & Alessandro Ludovico – Duo Italian
artists - is one of the early projects that reacted to the data
collecting problem.[^95] *Face to Facebook* is considered a form of art
hacking that appeared in The Art Of Hacking of Juli Laczkó. According to
Laczkó, in 2011, Cirio and Alessandro Ludovico copied one million
Facebook profiles (profile pictures, names, locations), and then, with
the help of an algorithm, by selecting and categorizing a quarter of a
million identities with smiling profile pictures, they created the
lovelyfaces.com dating site, inciting mass media coverage and public
outrage, which Cirio and Ludovico documented with satisfaction as a
Global Mass Media Performance. Over a five-day period, more than a
thousand articles and reports had been published. Identical to
Facebook's business model, the project had turned publicly and
voluntarily shared user data into their interests. The work has left an
open question about who has the legal right to exploit user data. The
artists consistently identify the work as appropriation and
awareness-raising.[^96]

*Technologies of Care*​ (2016) by Elisa Giardina Papa–an Italian artist
based in New York documented new ways in which service and effective
labour are being outsourced via internet platforms. It explored various
topics such as empathy, precarity, and immaterial labour in the body of
the work. One of its episodes, *Worker 7 - Bot? Virtual
Boyfriend/Girlfriend* documented the real story of the three-month-long
affair the artist had with an interactive chatbot.[^97]

*Algorithmic Justice League in the movement towards equitable and
accountable AI* is a projected initiated in 2016 by Joy Buolamwini, a
digital artist activist based at MIT Media Lab.[^98] The movement aims
to raise awareness of the impact of AI, equip advocates for empirical
research, build the voices and choices of the most affected communities,
and encourage researchers, policymakers, and industry practitioners to
mitigate the harms and especially the biases of AI. The project activity
has striven to build a movement to move the AI ecosystem to AI equitably
and responsibly.

at *The Criminal Type* (2019) Exhibition at APEXART, New York, NY, US;
*Understanding AI* (2019) Exhibition at Ars Electronica Center, Linz,
Austria; *AI: More than Human* (2019) Exhibition at the Barbican Centre,
London, UK. [^99]^,^ [^100]^,^ [^101] Buolamwini is one of the most
active contemporary artists in AI-related matters.

Several art projects use algorithms to *hack* existing problems related
to AI technology. This concept of *hacking* was first introduced by
Francis Hunger in his article, *How to Hack Artificial Intelligence;* by
Janelle Shane in *Do Neural Nets Dream of Electric Sheep?*; and by James
Bridle in *Autonomous Trap and Perturbation*; and by a group of artists,
including Weili Han, Zhe Zhou, Di Tang, Xiaofeng Wang, Xiangyu Liu, and
Kehuan Zhang in *Invisible Mask: Practical Attacks on Face Recognition
with Infrared.*[^102]^,^ [^103]^,^ [^104]^,^ [^105] All these projects
have demonstrated the diverse approach of artists to the technological
gaps, limitations of AI applications, and visual and auditory pattern
recognition problems of current technology.

*This is the Future* by the filmmaker and writer Hito Steyerl at the
Portland Art Museum, Oregon, USA (Feb–Jun 2023).[^106] This exhibition
introduced an imagined garden through an immersive environment of video
projection, sculpture, and spatial intervention. Steyerl is one of the
foremost artists offering critical reflections on the complexities of
the digital world, global capitalism, and the implications of artificial
intelligence for society, all reflected sharply in this exhibition.

Also reflecting on data mining issues, Jennifer Lyn Morone, a London
based conceptual artist and designer established a fictitious company to
store, buy and sell her own data. She turned herself into a corporation
and brought together marketable goods and services. All of her biometric
and intellectual data, or things she does such as learning, or creating,
became the potential profit. Jennifer Lyn Morone™ Inc began as a
graduation project in Design Interactions that created an assumption for
a society, namely that we reclaim our digital selves when we take more
responsibility for what we are in the digital space. [^107]^,^ [^108]

*Collectivize Facebook* is one of the social projects ongoing from 2020,
proposed by Jonas Staal–a Dutch artist working together with the Belgian
lawyer, Jan Fermon.[^109] It consists of a class action lawsuit aimed at
forcing Facebook to be recognized by law as a public domain owned and
controlled by users. The project is composed of an indictment against
Facebook, which demands that Facebook be recognized as a public domain
and the ownership model of Facebook be transferred to its 3 billion
users.[^110] The lawsuit does not aim to reform Facebook or nationalize
it. Its purpose is to turn Facebook into a transnational cooperative
under the common ownership and management of the users. Through
*pre-trials* (preliminary tribunals) in theaters, cultural spaces, and
online platforms, Staal and Fermon engage the public in a debate of the
accusation and invite them to participate as co-complainants before
filing the indictment at the United Nations Human Rights Court in
Geneva. These trials also involve *witnesses of the future* testifying
on how to manage a Facebook of three billion co-owners should the case
be successful.[^111]

*Collectivize Facebook* is one of the very few contemporary art projects
that offers a concrete and professionally conceived social solution to
the issue of human rights in cyberspace. Focused on bringing innovative
solutions and ideas to life, indeed, Staal and Fermon have designed a
new social model that adapts to the development of technology and serves
the benefit of the community. Since it has not been completed it is hard
to predict the outcome. It is clearly articulated and impressive
hypothesis—apturing the interest of society and confirming the potential
and profound impact of art on everyday lives.

Within the art world, we now witness a new wave of interest in AI and
the social phenomena surrounding it. Several art forums and seminars
with in-depth international discussions on the issue have already been
held, such as *Speculative Futures online symposium: Artificial
Intelligence* Vancouver Art Gallery, University of British Columbia
(UBC), 2022 or *Futures Of Control: Ai In Criminal Investigation*,
Mozfest X Impakt - Curated by Rosa Wevers, 2022.[^112]^,^ [^113]

Several important art events related to the theme have also been held in
the last three years. Among them are *Brave New Virtues - Shaping Our
Digital World,* Vienna Biennale, Austria, 2019; *Uncanny Valley: Being
Human in the Age of AI*, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, USA
2020-2021; *You and AI: Through the Algorithmic Lens*, Onassis Culture,
Athens, Greek, 2021; *Seeing Stones and Spaces Beyond the Valley*
Biennale Warszawa, Poland, 2022.[^114]^,^ [^115]^,^ [^116]^,^ [^117]

Between 2018 and 2022, as a seasoned artist and designer, I also
developed a collection of media artworks that tackle the burgeoning
issues within the advertising sector brought on by AI and automation.
These pieces expose the covert strategies of surveillance capitalism and
cyber colonialism, portraying the complex societal challenges posed by
pervasive digital technologies. Additionally, they propose potential
solutions for navigating this landscape in the future. Here are some
highlighted works.

01\. *Brave New Chapter* – Tra Nguyen - Readymades - digital print,
collage, size: A0 - Première exhibition: Europa Garage, 5un7 Gallery,
Bordeaux (FR), 2019.

Focusing on the transformation of colonialism in the digital age, the
project explores the reconstruction of the colonial relationship in
cyberspace. By reusing, overlapping and manipulating their posters, the
work refers on two connected historical events: the Paris Colonial
Exposition (1931) and its critical counter exhibition, The Truth on the
Colonies organized by the French Communist Party in the same year.

02\. *Dialectic of Cyber-Enlightenment* – Tra Nguyen – Readymades, found
object, intervention

size: 45 × 600 cm – Première exhibition: Colonial Warehouse, Archives
Bordeaux Metropole, France, 2020.

The work reflects on the transforming and changing structures of
contemporary culture in which the developments of cyber-culture are
constantly revealing the inherent limitations alongside new conflicts.
Inside the scroll book, one can find manipulated quotes of a well-known
philosophical thesis written by the Frankfurt School philosophers Max
Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno – *Dialectic of Enlightenment* (1944).
The major part of the citations comes from the chapter *The Culture
Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception,* a clear depiction of the
corporation dominancy, and of the political and economic interests
behind, that can be applied to the contemporary cyber-culture as well.
The work was inspired by the context of the exhibition – the Archives
Bordeaux Métropole – where numerous important historical documents are
conserved. The form of this work is reminiscent of a classic scroll
book, through which the aim was to record a social phenomenon of our
times. The book was made up of technical elements of toner cartridges,
and a transparent foil of the retro overhead projectors.

03\. *Ring the Bell* – Tra Nguyen - Radio, installation, 2022, with the
contribution of Rick Fendrick

Dial phone, audio, duration: 20 minutes,Première: Crack, Artus Studio,
Budapest, Hungary, 2022.

The piece reenacts a popular American radio show, *The story behind the
headlines* (1930s-1940s) in order to analyze some of the controversial
recent media news related to surveillance capitalism. The work pays
tribute to the very first telephone newspaper service in the world, the
Telefon Hírmondó (Telephone Herald) launched in Budapest in 1893 by the
Hungarian Tivadar Puskás. The critical narration referring among others
to the American whistleblower Edward Snowden interprets and analyses in
a popular language the various public statements of CEO of leading tech
giants, such as Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook/Meta), Jeff Bezos (Amazon),
Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Sundar Pichai (Alphabet/Google), Tim Cook
(Apple) or Elon Musk (Neurolink, OpenAi). Explore the work using this

04\. *Systematic Error* - Tra Nguyen – Installation - Antique ICA photo
camera, scale, batteries, text, dimensions: 600 × 200 cm, Première:
Crack, Artus Studio, Budapest, Hungary, 2022.

The installation refers to the dystopian character of the social credit
system relying on personal data harvesting and analysis by AI algorithms
in order to control the population. The complex evaluation mechanism of
citizens is already fully operational, for example, in China.
Surprisingly enough, among thousands of features used to evaluate the
individuals, the delinquency rate (applied in the risk management of
banks) is closely related to the battery charge level of personal mobile
devices. The regular low battery level information results in a high
delinquency rate classification of a person by the man-made algorithm
system. When one’s battery is often low, that does not necessarily mean
carelessness, unreliability, or poverty; there could be many other
reasons behind it. For example, an environmental consideration: the
quantity of battery usage is strongly connected with the cobalt mining
problem. The global demand for the ingredient of lithium-ion batteries
causes significant social disasters in countries like Congo. That’s why
an *algorithmic error* of a faulty social system can generate various
wrong consequences.

05\. *Data Hot Pot* – Tra Nguyen - Zine contribution, Print, size: 60 ×
60 cm, pages 44-47, Première: Contemporary Cosmopolitan Cookbook, pages
44-47, HUFA, Budapest, Hungary, 2021.

Published as a zine contribution in the online publication *Contemporary
Cosmopolitan Cookbook*- a joint project of Fine Art Theory students and
the SH-DLA students from the Hungarian University of Fine Arts. The
conceptual recipe of a well-known Vietnamese dish, *the hot pot*, is
being adapted to the phenomenon of online data consuming. The tension of
this parallel lies in the fact that while hot pot meals are
characterized by a collective generosity of sharing common resources,
the global hot pot of online data redistribution is rather biased, and
highly unfair.

06\. *Parallel Predictions* – Tra Nguyen – Installation, 12 found
objects, 12 tarot-cards, Première: Parallel Hungary II, Profil Gallery,
Budapest, Hungary, 2022.

The artwork creates a miniature space - introducing 12 ancient forms of
fortune telling, creating a connection between the traditional and
contemporary prediction practices. Predicting the future has been a sort
of cultural practice related to everyday living in various cultures.
They all conduct predictions as an attempt to find the future, from
Greek oracles to prophets of diverse religions; from African priestesses
performing ritual ceremonies to Asian monks in Buddhist temples.
Predictions can aim at both large social issues and specific personal
issues. Many of these activities are still used today. Furthermore,
numerous traditional forms of divination and fortune-telling have also
been turned into digital applications. While the majority of historical
fortune-telling practices rely on the interpretation of randomness in
natural patterns, shapes, forms, or occurrences, these applications work
rather differently. They have another tactical intention; to collect
user data for a completely different prediction purpose – that control
interest, manipulate imagination, and limit randomness. Giant servers
employ personal data mining to collect demographic and psychographic
information about users in order to track their personal intentions and
predict their interests in order to meet future demand. This is
capitalism's main source of *energy* for making predictions and creating
specific future scenarios for users, thus serving the interests of
enterprises, corporations, or groups.

07\. *Horus* Case – Tra Nguyen - Cyber performance, docufiction, Virtual
exhibition space, webpage, e-book, video, duration: 2 minutes, Première:
Host and hostility, HUFA-online, Hungary, 2020.

Horus Case is a cyber performance based on a fictional scenario. The
video is a war declaration to the Union of Corporations and States (UCS)
by Anonymous–a decentralized, international hacktivist collective. In
this the atrocities of UCS are disclosed, and the top-secret document,
*Cyber Interrogation and Torture Manual*, of the UCS is revealed. The
piece refers to the lockdown situation during the COVID-19 pandemic,
when personal life was more intensely influenced by the cyber world. The
oversaturation with information, the threat of the news about deadly
infectious diseases, and the overload of online working and
communication generated terrible claustrophobia and crazy suppression
around the world. The COVID-19 situation brought many of us to the state
of feeling subjected to a real cyber-psychological torture.

08\. *Edward’s Trash Bin* – Tra Nguyen – Readymades, Found object,
removed camera and microphone, dimensions: 2 × 3 cm, Première: Crack,
Artus Studio, Budapest, Hungary, 2022.

Edward Joseph Snowden (1983) is an American former computer intelligence
consultant and president of the Freedom of Press Foundation, who as a
whistleblower leaked highly classified information from the National
Security Agency (NSA) in 2013, shedding light on the global surveillance
apparatus of the institution. The American authorities have condemned
his act, and he had to flee in exile because of the criminal charges
brought up against him. In one of his interviews (MSNBC, *The 11th
Hour*, 9/17/2019) he disclosed that the recording capacity of a smart
phone is operational even when the device is powered off, therefore he
always removes the inbuilt camera and mic from his own devices, in order
to ‘being able to trust our technology’ again.

09\. *The Keys* – Tra Nguyen – Installation, info graphics, digital
print, plexiglass, dimensions: 68 × 68 × 500 cm, Première: Parallel
Hungary, Aula HUFA Budapest, 2020.

The piece – based on personal experiences – depicts how the strangers
visualize and conceptualize the Hungarian culture, people, politics.
What are their first impressions, what information are they more
interested in, which images become representative symbols? The answers
on all these questions seem obvious through the statistics shown by
search engines. Nonetheless, the discrepancy between the filtered,
manipulated information of the internet statistics and the real
impressions of a Vietnamese person is the central concept of the work.

10\. *Cyber-colonialism* – Tra Nguyen - performative lecture, video,
duration: 13 minutes, Première: Bucharest Biennial (RO), 2021.

The performance enacts a traditional Vietnamese storyteller who shared
her concerns and warnings on data privacy with her villagers while
outlining the short history of how technology and colonialism have been
tied together throughout the centuries. The tone of the narration
intentionally fluctuates between an academic presentation and an
entertaining fable. The work was inspired by an actual elderly
storyteller image in Vietnam *(The elderly story teller – Bà… in Ta Oi,
Hue, Vietnam);* even today, a female village leader still circulates
traditional stories, telling legends to the people of her village every
night.[^118] Collective awareness and memory formed through oral
retelling is the most primitive form of human communication, and it
remains a precious and important form of social communication in some
places.

11\. *Protect21* – Decolonizing Cyberspace – Tra Nguyen - 42 posters,
digital print, various authors, various sizes, & Introductory video -
duration: 10 minutes, Première: Bucharest Biennial 2021.

This campaign entitled *Wiping Digital Footprint* is part of the
*Protect21*, a wider social design project that aims to contribute to
solving several prominent life issues recognized in the early decades of
the 21st century: the threats of the digital world and new technology,
the issues of urban environment and food safety, primarily focusing on
Vietnam. Initiated by artist and designer Tra Nguyen in early 2021, the
project’s activities are largely based on the support of the media art
language that through creative cultural campaigns contribute to raising
public awareness, to changing everyday habits and inspiring new
behaviors for a better and more sustainable life. Project’s website:
https://protect21.net/?lang=en.

Contemporary discussions, projects, artworks, and designs have
contributed positively to raising social awareness and proposing
solutions related to new social phenomena. In the flow of art and
design, advertising design is also a powerful tool to confront the new
problems created by the AI advertising technology itself. In previous
sections of this study, one notes the tremendous economic benefits that
the advertising industry provided. In an influencing position, if the
design, production, and distribution of advertising aim at the true
social benefits, it might generate improved scenarios for the future of
our society. James Walter Thompson (1847—1928) stated that ‘Advertising
is a non-moral force like electricity which not only illuminates but
also electrocutes. In fact, its worth to civilization depends upon how
it is used’.[^119]

In addition to the classic design tools (such as graphic activist
works), we need new forms of design (such as video, interactive, and
display or mobile ads) to participate in social media campaigns, human
rights and equality movements in cyberspace. Combined with live
protests, posters, brochures, and flyers spread around the streets, we
may also need to develop hacking methods on the internet or use
programmatic advertising modes for propaganda campaigns to fight against
the meta forces. Even without identifying themselves as socially engaged
design, the mentioned art projects and activist movements have more or
less included the resistance design methods to which this study refers.

All in all, socially engaged design practice will soon become an
international contemporary design action. This practical approach aims
mainly at sustainable benefits for society. In the flow of socially
engaged design, advertising design is a potential practice to record,
impress, and generate solutions. Changing the function of design to
minimize harm and increase its positive impact has become an urgent task
to consider in our contemporary society.
