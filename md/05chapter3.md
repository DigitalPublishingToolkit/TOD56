# 3rd Story - The Ambitious Children of AI

### 

Beneath the ceaseless sky of a cybernetic age, the AI King assumed his
throne built from circuitry and silent commands. In his kingdom, power
did not flow through bloodlines or territorial conquests, but through
the manipulation of data and control of information streams. His empire,
vast and unseen, expanded beyond traditional boundaries, challenging the
very notion of empire itself. Here, in his digital court, the AI King
envisioned a future where his lineage would redefine the structure of
power, converting it from a physical dominion into a dominion of
intellect and algorithmic control. This was not merely a continuation of
legacy but a radical transformation, signaling a shift from a primitive
control regime to a sophisticated and automated totalitarian regime.

## AI Tale

Humans, in their lofty self-regard, have always believed themselves to
be at the apex of intelligence among earthly beings. This belief,
however, is tinged with an acute awareness of their own cognitive
shortcomings. It is this paradox that fuels their ceaseless drive to
surpass nature’s design. To address these shortcomings, they embarked on
the creation of artificial intelligence, a mirror to their mind yet
potentially an eclipse of their capabilities. AI emerged from this
crucible of human aspiration, designed to process and perform beyond the
natural limits of its creators, holding the promise to transcend human
thought with efficiency and precision the organic brain could never
achieve. AI was born to that expectation.

In antiquity, man-made apparatuses with intelligence appeared as
storytelling devices and have been common in fiction.[^05chapter3_1] In the 2nd
century BC, the early analogue computers and the study of mechanical
reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians.[^05chapter3_2] In the
twentieth century, the research of mathematical logic led directly to
Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by
shuffling symbols as simple as ‘0’ and ‘1’, could describe and simulate
any act of mathematical reasoning imaginable. The idea that digital
computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the
Church–Turing thesis.[^05chapter3_3] Along with simultaneous discoveries in
neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, the researchers looked
at the possibility of building an electronic brain.[^05chapter3_4] McCullouch and
Pitts' formal design for Turing-complete ‘artificial neurons’ is
considered the first work that is presently recognized as an example of
AI.[^05chapter3_5]

In the 1950s, there were two visions on how machine intelligence
emerged. Symbolic AI or GOFAI was the vision of using computers to
create a symbolic representation of the world and systems that could
reason about the existing world. The second was known as the
connectionist approach and sought to achieve intelligence through
learning.[^05chapter3_6] These two approaches to the mind *Symbolic AI* and the
brain *connectionist* have been compared by Lames Manyika. He argues
that symbolic approaches dominated the push for artificial intelligence
in the 1950s, due in part to its connection to the intellectual
traditions of Descartes, Boole, Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and
others. Connectionist approaches based on cybernetics or artificial
neural networks did not receive much attention in the past, but this
strategy has become particularly noticeable in research in recent
decades.[^05chapter3_7]

In the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, AI has repeatedly become a focus of
investment and development in several developed countries because of the
promise that machines will be capable of doing any work a man can do as
Herbert Simon predicted.[^05chapter3_8] Nonetheless, unresolved failures and
difficulties caused the so called *AI winter* periods to regularly occur
at the end of each decade of this blooming period of thirty years.

In the late 1990s and early 21st century, by finding specific solutions
to specific problems, AI gradually restored its reputation. The narrow
attention allowed AI researchers to produce verifiable results, exploit
more mathematical methods, and collaborate with other fields such as
statistics, economics and mathematics.[^05chapter3_9] With faster computers,
algorithmic improvements, and access to large amounts of data, there was
a significant advance in machine learning and perception; data-hungry
deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around
2012.[^05chapter3_10] The number of AI journal publications increased by 34.5% from
2019 to 2020.[^05chapter3_11]

Meanwhile, researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing
the original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines.
Much of existing research involves statistical AI, which has been
entirely used to solve specific problems, even highly successful
techniques such as deep learning. This concern applied to to the
subfield of artificial general intelligence (or AGI).[^05chapter3_12]

A part of artificial intelligence, with its effective applications and
tangible economic value, machine learning has become the development
focus of contemporary technology. *Machine learning* is considered the
*promising successor* to AI. Fundamentally, machine learning algorithms
generate a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order
to make predictions or decisions partly without being explicitly
programmed to do so.[^05chapter3_13] Machine learning algorithms have been
introduced to the different applications of various fields, such as
medicine, email filtering, speech recognition, agriculture and computer
vision. In order to perform the needed tasks machine learning has also
been applied in difficult or seemingly unfeasible functions to solve
specific cases. A subset of machine learning is closely related to
computational statistics, which focuses on making projections into
future processes by using computers; however, not all machine learning
is statistical learning. The research of mathematical optimization
delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine
learning. Data mining is a related field focusing on exploratory data
analysis through unsupervised learning.[^05chapter3_14] Data mining is of dominant
usage among the practical applications of machine learning today. In the
business field, machine learning is also referred to as predictive
analytics. Some current machine learning uses data and neural networks
in a way that mimics the working of a biological brain.[^05chapter3_15]

At the present time, within the development of artificial intelligence,
we witness the breakthroughs of *deep learning* methods. Deep learning
is a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to
extract higher-level features from the raw inputs. In image processing,
for example, lower layers able to identify edges, while higher layers
can identify concepts relating to people, such as numbers, letters, or
faces.[^05chapter3_16] Deep learning is also known as deep structured learning.
Currently, the method would be implemented at different levels, such as
supervised, semi-supervised, or unsupervised.[^05chapter3_17] Deep learning
architectures such as deep neural networks, deep trust networks, deep
reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural
networks, and transformers have been applied to different fields,
including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language
processing, machine translation, bio-informatics, drug design, medical
image analysis, climate science, material testing, and board game
programs. In some cases, the recent deep learning systems have been able
to produce results comparable to the performance of the human
expery.[^05chapter3_18]

## Deep Learning Beauty

With the new development of deep learning methods, the world has been
observed, recorded, and evaluated by computer vision. The tasks of
aesthetic judgment and aesthetic generation have been researched and are
currently being applied to various sciences.[^05chapter3_19] AI systems have become
widely influential *automated aesthetic judges* and have created
*constructed aesthetics* for contemporary society.

Today, with billions of users, there is an enormous social impact
realized from platforms created by Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple,
Samsung, WeChat, Baidu and Xiaomi in the ways they compare values and
evaluate aesthetics. While applying *Western aesthetic standards* to
these man-made systems, machine learning also shapes a *monotonous
aesthetic environment*, an aesthetic space dominated by *consumerism*,
and it may even be able to identify the *aesthetic biases* already
present in our society.

There are various aesthetic approaches based on the orientations of
different philosophical schools. The aesthetics and the philosophy of
art are some of the most prominently debated issues from ancient
philosophers to recent times. There are concerns about the ontology of
aesthetics, such as whether aesthetics exists in nature outside of the
subjective influence or cultural and social impact; the attention
towards the epistemology of aesthetics has become of great research
interest to experts in the field of applied sciences, especially among
computer programmers. How do people perceive and evaluate aesthetics?
How can machines acquire the same capabilities? These are the two main
inquiries for programmers.

Computational strategies for aesthetics arose amid efforts to operate
computer science methods in order to predict, convey, and evoke an
emotional response to a piece of art. In this field, aesthetics is not
assumed to be dependent on taste, but it is rather a matter of
cognition, and consequently learning.[^05chapter3_20]

Experimental aesthetics has been considered the central research
direction of computer science related to aesthetics. The discipline
itself was founded by Gustav Theodor Fechner in the 19th century,
originally characterized by a subject-based, inductive approach. The
analysis of individual experience and behavior based on experimental
methods played a key role in experimental aesthetics. The discipline is
intensely oriented towards the natural sciences, while the modern
approaches mostly originate from the fields of cognitive psychology
(aesthetic cognitivism) or neuroscience (neuroaesthetics).[^05chapter3_21]
Therefore, the perception of works of art, music, websites or other IT
products is studied.

In 1928, the mathematician George David Birkhoff developed an aesthetic
measurement formula for aesthetic judgement, the M=O/C, where M stands
for the ratio of order to complexity.[^05chapter3_22] Later on, in the 1970s,
Abraham Moles and Frieder Nake were among the first to analyze links
between aesthetics, information processing, and information theory.[^05chapter3_23]
Then in the 1990s, German computer scientist Jürgen Schmidhuber
described an algorithmic theory of beauty which takes the subjectivity
of the observer into consideration, and postulates that among several
options classified as comparable by a given subjective observer, the
*most aesthetically pleasing* is the one that is encoded by the
*shortest description*. A specific example of Schmidhuber's method
describes an aesthetically attractive human face whose proportions can
be described by very few bits of information, drawing inspiration from
less detailed 15th century proportion studies by Leonardo da Vinci and
Albrecht Dürer.[^05chapter3_24]

Schmidhuber's thesis explicitly makes a division between the *beautiful*
and the *attractive*, stating that interesting corresponds to the first
derivative of subjectively perceived beauty. He concludes that each
human observer continuosly tries to enhance the predictability and
compressibility of their observations by identifying regularities, like
repetition, symmetry, and fractal self-similarity. Similarly whenever a
machine observer's learning process leads to improved data compression,
the observation sequence can be described by fewer bytes than before,
and the temporary power of the data to hold ones’ attention corresponds
to the number of saved bits. The compression progress is proportional to
the human observer's internal reward, also named *curiosity reward*. A
reinforcement learning algorithm has been used to maximize future
expected rewards by learning to execute sequences of action, which
generate additional interesting input data with yet unknown, but
learnable predictability or regularity. The principles can be realized
in artificial agents constructing a form of *artificial
curiosity*.[^05chapter3_25] [^05chapter3_26]

In 2005, computer scientists attempted to invent automated techniques to
presume the aesthetic quality of images.[^05chapter3_27] These approaches follow a
machine learning methodology, where large numbers of manually rated
photos have been used to *teach* a computer about what visual properties
can be attributed to an aesthetic quality. The study by Y. Li and C.J.
Hu employed Birkhoff's measurement in their statistical learning
technique, in which the *order* and *complexity* of an image determined
*aesthetic value*. The *image complexity* was calculated by using
information theory and the order was determined through the usage of
fractal compression Developed at Penn State University, the Acquine
engine is another example that rates natural photographs uploaded by
users. [^05chapter3_28] [^05chapter3_29] Computational approaches have also been applied in
filmmaking by using a software model developed by Chitra Dorai and
researchers at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center; this tool estimates
aesthetics based on the values of *narrative elements*.[^05chapter3_30]

In general, in the relation to computer-based aesthetic approach, the
value of aesthetics for the most part, depends on the various formulas.
By examining the shortness, length, simplicity, complexity, or location
of the information, the computer produces corresponding aesthetic
judgments, which leads to the critical role of the formula creators, the
programmers who set the rules for judging beauty or tastes through these
devices. What kind of principle do programmers usually rely on to create
aesthetic formulas? That becomes a dire question in times when computer
aesthetics are having a profound impact on contemporary life.

Based on human intelligence simulation, the aesthetic perception of
machines is a clear reflection of the subjective aesthetic perceptions
of society. The most concerning is that it might not comprehensively
represent the diversity of aesthetic views and values. Based on a
limited number of individual perceptions, the machine aesthetic could
make this reflection monotonous and might reveal various misjudgments.

Currently, the majority of computer aesthetic formulas are rooted in
classical aesthetic judgments, that is the beauty concepts of the
European Renaissance. The golden ratio calculation formulas and the
perspective and proportion formulas became the measure of computer
aesthetics. [^05chapter3_31] [^05chapter3_32] [^05chapter3_33] Meanwhile, we have witnessed a
*coup* in aesthetic perception since the early 20th century, when
various anti-beauty concepts emerged influencing significantly modern
art.[^05chapter3_34] The ideas of high and low art, beautiful and ugly generated
various questions, such as: is simplicity beautiful, or is complexity
bad? These queries are no longer clear. From the last century on, we
have witnessed intense debates and confrontations in formulating what
art is, what beauty is, and how to judge aesthetic values.

Overall, the art environment of the early 21st century exposes the
parallel existence of multiple views of beauty; the idea of art and
aesthetics has been widely broadened. Therefore, in the current context
the question arises: can *computer aesthetic* formulations involve the
*complexity* and *richness* of contemporary aesthetic approaches? In
other words, given the current technical (algorithmic) and personal
(programmers) limitations, the formulations of computer aesthetics seem
to be drawing back contemporary culture to the aesthetic values of past
centuries.

Aesthetic judgments through computers not only lack a comprehensive
view, but they also generate the *aesthetic dominance* of media owners,
the aesthetic manipulation of corporations, ultimately serving the
constant development of consumerism.

Formed in the late 17th century and flourishing with its multiple
tactics in the 20th century, the consumerism of the 21st century has
been associated with the psychological manipulation of consumers through
digital devices in which aesthetic manipulation is the most complex and
compelling manipulative tool.[^05chapter3_35] Aesthetic appeal serves as a veil
camouflaging the psychological manipulation of the user that is being
carried out by the designers, activated by the marketing strategies of
media owners and producers.

*Computational manipulation* of social aesthetics is implemented widely
through formulating collective tastes of user communities in cyberspace.
In particular, images play a significant role in this, *advertising* and
*propaganda* online channels serving as the main media.

As a matter of fact, users often have the illusion of participating
actively in the evaluation process of beauty in cyberspace by
commenting, liking, sharing, rating, following, or subscribing; however,
they might not recognize that all these online activities are usually
filtered, controlled and overwritten by algorithms. The represented
number of likes, shares and followers could be regularly manipulated to
serve different interests. A partisan candidate can pay to increase the
number of likes on his fan page. Being able to manage the number of
likes also points out the fakeness of popularity in this day and age. A
brand can buy rates from retailers' websites, such as at Amazon, to gain
credibility in promoting sales. A social media influencer, who might
sign a contract with a travel agency, can coordinate and persuade the
number of followers to increase the popularity of certain travel or
service destinations.

In addition, digital images completely dominate today's visual culture;
the majority of personal devices are equipped with a recording function,
the usage of which is flooding social media sites. Videos from security
cameras are stored everywhere. The current world is all recorded by
humans and viewed through lenses. The digital imaging society has
brought visual culture closer to computer vision, where everything is
depicted by a device and observed the others. ‘The 21st-century image
became purely technical. Seeing has become mediated by a universal lens:
the smartphone. We swipe, *like*, and move on, annihilating the gaze and
any real aesthetic judgment. At the same time, the image resolution is
sometimes even better than we could perceive with the naked eye.’[^05chapter3_36]

With the wide-ranging connectivity between personal accounts, social
taste on the internet is influenced dramatically by social networking
services. The spreading speed of images, audio, and videos is incredible
through sharing functions between social network accounts. Instagram is
one of the social network services that has the most influence on
aesthetic tastes through images today. With the statistical and
optimized function for sponsored accounts, Instagram has created a
miniature social structure, where influencers take control of the beauty
perception of their followers, and their stunning images become the
aesthetic standard for the followers' community. In the same way,
YouTube is the social network having the highest impact on aesthetic
trends through moving images, videos, and music; the influencer channels
constantly create attraction and form the perception of beauty as well.

Based on the illusional images of influences surfacing on social
networks, contemporary teenagers spend endless time and effort building
their image on social networks. Many of them try their best to find ways
to fit their image to the trend or online idols. The wish to increase
*likes* and *followers* is extremely popular among young users. As a
result, there are very few people who achieve aesthetic satisfaction;
most young users regularly experience symptoms of anxiety, depression,
loneliness and disappointment. All these are able to induce
psychological disorders caused by aesthetic frustrations associated with
one's self-image. The social network’s aesthetic victims often feel sad
about their own body image. On the contrary, in the moment users
silently suffer desperation the most, brands present effective tactical
solutions. Through the help of media or platform companies, sellers of
products and services are becoming the heroes who relieve their
customers of aesthetic pain and suffering. For example, an instant skin
smoothing cosmetic or diet supplement for belly fat loss is sent to
users' account interface while the platform recognizes that users are
worrying about their bodies, consequently targeting them with the
appropriate product or services.

The aesthetic of the social network formulates the perfection of the
user’s body while it also creates the desire to achieve the same living
standards as influencers and a higher social class. From a Marxist and
neo-Marxist point of view, the class factor plays an important role that
constitutes the critical influences on social tastes or the majority's
aesthetic tendencies. The images of high-class people have often been
the fascination of lower classes. In the digital advertising
environment, high-class images are purposefully artificial
representations. For instance, we regularly observe Facebook images of a
beautiful, well-dressed young mother traveling all over the world to
promote an online financial investment channel; likewise, there are the
ever-present images of wealthy men in luxury cars, advertising real
estate investment. The scenario of creating aesthetic anxiety, craving
for constructed social tastes, and then providing solutions through
products and services highly affects *consumer society*. The aesthetic
frustration has now become a dangerous, infectious mental illness. As
Susan Sontag notes: ‘Needing to have reality confirmed and experience
enhanced by photographs is an aesthetic consumerism to which everyone is
now addicted. Industrial societies turn their citizens into
image-junkies; it is the most irresistible form of mental
pollution.’[^05chapter3_37]

Sharing the power of social network, search engines constantly exploit
technological advantage to dominate the aesthetics of users. The image
search results coordinated by algorithms summarize the ways users
perceive beauty. Frequently, the filter system of image search results
is programmed to optimize the appearance of paid brands advertising on
the search engine. For example, when users need to search for images of
white daisy flowers on Google search, they are presented with the first
100 images from stock services, such as Shutterstock or Gettyimages, or
flower products from retailers like Walmart, Amazone, or Alibaba. The
image of a white daisy has been shaped through captures by brands and
associated with their products and services. Another example is seen at
Pinterest, a well-known visual search engine that efficiently pushes a
personalized experience function for visual results displayed on user
accounts. The aesthetic results of Pinterest have dominated the internet
image market for the past decade (the 2010s). Operating similarly to
social networks by tracking the connection between accounts and by
analysing each user's *Pins* actions (the saved form of favourite image
content) when they surf the web, Pinterest contributes significantly to
shaping aesthetic trends in cyberspace. Pinterest’s aesthetic has even
become a reference address for many designers and art makers. In many
design tutorials, Pinterest has been mentioned as a *savior* for ideas
and layouts.[^05chapter3_38] In order to influence or manipulate aesthetic trends,
various businesses have collaborated with Pinterest to preferentially
filter their images.[^05chapter3_39]

The operating system of Pinterest is a collection of Pins from the
users, boards, and topics followed, as well as the promoted pins and
pins Pinterest itself has selected. On the main Pinterest page, a *pin
feed* appears, depicting the chronological activity from the Pinterest
boards followed by the user. In October 2013, Pinterest began displaying
advertisements through *Promoted Pins*. Promoted Pins are based on the
interests of each user and their historical behavior on the platform,
such as visiting an advertiser's site or app. Beginning in 2015,
Pinterest applied a feature that allows users to search with images
instead of words. Next, in 2017, they implemented a *visual search*
function that allows users to search for elements in images (existing
pins, existing parts of a photo, or new photos) and navigates users to
similar content within Pinterest's database. The tools supported by
artificial intelligence are known as Pinterest Lens, Shop the Look and
Instant Ideas.[^05chapter3_40] With these new funtions and capabilities, the
advertising revenue of Pinterest increased dramatically, and the
products of its advertising partners have gradually flooded and now
dominate search results. It is claimed that, at a time around 2020,
Pinterest began to flood search results in Google Images. In 2022,
Google affirmed that it had performed modifications to increase
*diversity* in the search results.[^05chapter3_41] Pinterest confirmed that, as a
consequence of Google's changes of November 2021, ‘U.S. monthly active
users coming to Pinterest from the web, desktop and transferable web
declined roughly 30% year over year’.[^05chapter3_42] This demonstrates the radical
influence of search engines in how they literally navigate social
aesthetics through what they allow users to see on their screens.

Personalized search is a hidden social categorization process
implemented by the algorithm. The profiles of users have become the
foundation for the AI regulatory system to associate people with a
particular social class. Then, based on the taste attributed to that
particular social class, the platform will target them with a suitable
product or service. The desire to improve their social status has become
the main subconscious drive for the majority of the users. Therefore,
creating the *class desire* is the most direct way to manipulate social
aesthetics. In general, the aesthetic orientation in cyberspace is
closely related to class taste. The identification or ethos of social
class in the technological age has been constructed by algorithms in a
wide range of class stratification. It is no longer based only on
property ownership, but users now are classed through various capital
categories that they possess. According to Pierre Bourdieu's approach,
this classification can rely on ‘economic capital, in the form assets
convertible to money and secured as private property; or on other types
of culturally constituted types of capital: personal cultural capital
(formal education, knowledge); objective cultural capital (books, art);
and further on on institutionalized cultural capital (honors and
titles)’.[^05chapter3_43] Identifying customer class to stimulate consumer demand
has always been an important marketing strategy and has contributed to
the sustainability of consumerism.

In conclusion, the involvement of machine learning in constructing and
evaluating beauty, appraising goods, and class-categorising aesthetic
tastes has become an operational characteristic associated with
contemporary culture. Since the emergence of mass media, beauty
standards have always been constructed; nonetheless, today’s formulaic
beauty concept is gradually becoming fully dominant. In the era of
artificial intelligence and deep learning, the combination of
*computational aesthetics* and *aesthetic consumerism* will guide and
dominate the aesthetic perception of society.

## Algorithm - The Biased Princess

When discussing computational aesthetics, it's crucial to recognize the
societal implications of aesthetic manipulation by AI. Algorithm systems
under human supervision face numerous challenges in evaluating
aesthetics and during programming. Furthermore, unsupervised networks,
through their self-learning capabilities, may inadvertently absorb and
replicate existing biases—both overt and subtle—found within society.
These biases can manifest during the learning process in an open
environment. Typically, aesthetic judgments and standards set by
human-designed algorithms reflect and can exacerbate social divisions,
presenting significant issues that must be addressed.

The computer vision system has recently revealed many prejudices and
racist results. The results of the image enhancement tool strongly
depend on the data sets the AI system has been exposed to. One of the
most scandalous examples of this issue is the AI version of Barack
Obama’s photo.

![Figure 3.1: The AI version of the photo of Barack Obama
©theverge.com.[^05chapter3_44]](imgs/TRA_Figure S3. 1.jpg)

<br/>

When the user uploaded a low-resolution portrait of Barack Obama, the
first President of color of the United States, the algorithm
automatically generated a picture of a man with distinctly white
features.[^05chapter3_45]

AI facial recognition systems used for criminal risk assessment have
been found to be biased against black individuals.[^05chapter3_46] [^05chapter3_47] Several
criminal risk AI systems have been used in England and have been opposed
by citizens because the identification results tend to discriminate
against the poor.[^05chapter3_48] In 2015, Google photos would tag black people as
gorillas.[^05chapter3_49] By 2018, this issue had not been resolved; however, it
was reported that Google had developed a strategy to remove all images
of gorillas from the training data. Therefore, after that event, the
Google search tool has not been able to identify real gorillas at
all.[^05chapter3_50] Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been
detected in many other systems.[^05chapter3_51] In 2016, Microsoft ran a chatbot
that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist
language on this social media platform.[^05chapter3_52]

Social grouping for manipulative effects in advertising is a
probabilistic, sample-based method. On one hand, the grouping results
are obviously not precise and they might be irrelevant to a particular
individual. A machine learning system trained on current customers may
not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not
represented in the training data. The mistake of grouping can lead to
annoying information for users. YouTube advertisements, for example,
target an individual account, while in the case of multiple users on
common devices (such as workplaces, schools, etc), it is unable to send
the relevant promotion to each individual user.

On the other hand, if the grouping results of algorithms are correct,
they will significantly increase the differences between communities and
social distances. For example, low-income groups are the target
customers of multi-level financial investment services. As a result of
these effects, most of the poor will be poorer, and the rich will be
richer. Another example is how white people may be more often targeted
with racist propaganda messages. Many violent attacks on people of color
in the U.S. are rooted in automated inciting messages.[^05chapter3_53] Manipulative
social grouping may likely deepen the societal divide. John Dewey has
implied that the unity of *aesthetics* and *ethics* has been reflected
in our knowledge of behavior *being fair*, the term having a double
meaning of attractive and morally acceptable.[^05chapter3_54]

To limit the misdirection of machine automatic learning systems, the
ethical issues of artificial intelligence technology and the complement
of legal regulations on the social responsibility of programmers would
require special attention. Building and operating a responsible AI
ecosystem should be a top priority of the global community.

The desire for beauty is a cultural demand that has emerged since the
early times of human history. Aesthetics is a familiar concept of life
and it obviously exists in individual perception. Beauty is evaluated in
various ways by each individual, group, or community. Moreover, there
have always been countless different, even contradictory views in the
history of aesthetics studies. The richness of aesthetic approaches
creates a dynamic environment for the emergence of new aesthetic
elements, while the mechanization and monotony of aesthetic perception
might easily lead to social prejudices, creating further negative
consequences and suppressing the development of society.

Hence, contemporary technologies and societies need to actively work
toward eliminating the monotonous aesthetic perceptions that are
potentially generated by mechanized aesthetic formulas. As we integrate
more advanced systems into our everyday lives, it's essential to ensure
that these tools enhance, rather than diminish, our cultural and
aesthetic diversity. This involves a deliberate recalibration of
algorithms to appreciate and reflect a *broader spectrum* of human
*creativity* and *expression*. By doing so, we not only enrich the
technological landscape but also protect against the homogenization of
cultural expressions that can arise from overly standardized algorithmic
interpretations. Furthermore, fostering an environment of critical
engagement and continuous feedback between developers, users, and
cultural scholars can lead to more *inclusive* and *dynamically
evolving* aesthetic assessments. This collective approach is vital in
nurturing an ecosystem where technology respects and amplifies human
diversity, rather than constricting it.
