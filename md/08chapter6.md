# 6th Story - Algorithmic Territories

Within the fractured web of human and artificial cognition, the tale
*Algorithmic Territories* unfolds—a narrative where the promise of a
*total* history collapses under its own ambition. As Claude Lévi-Strauss
postulated, history, when strained through the sieve of totality,
delivers nothing but a skewed portrait, incomplete and selective, marked
by discontinuities that belie the façade of continuity.[^08chapter6_1] This story
dives into the pulsing heart of advertising in the algorithmic age,
scrutinizing the interplay of politics, economics, geography, and
culture on a canvas that is both vast and intricately detailed. We will
be witnessing together the sociocultural flows through the digital
landscapes of Southeast Asia, adopting unique hues as they permeate the
diverse terrains of the region, painting a vivid tableau of how
automation and artificial intelligence reshape and redefine the contours
of cyber colonialism. This is not just the history of a region, but a
dissection of the very idea that a singular, coherent historical
narrative can ever truly capture the essence of human experience.

### 

## Southeast Asia’s Cyber Terrain

In Southest Asia, the dream of connecting with the world is a wish that
is not unique to any one person in particular. For people with a lower
standard of living and limited mobility, especially, the dream of
knowing the *world beyond*, one different from the familiar, becomes
even stronger. The Internet has brought high expectations to the
citizens of developing countries, especially in Southeast Asia. While
the Internet connects people to information, in itself the Internet is a
promise that opens the user to new employment, new opportunities and new
experiences. The global village - cyberspace - is expected to be the
driving force for *flattening the world*.[^08chapter6_2] Google, YouTube, Facebook,
Instagram, What's App, TikTok, Amazon, Alibaba, Apple, and Samsung have
given hope that new living conditions and international spaces will
allow the populations of developing countries access to a living
environment similar to the developed world.

Southeast Asia is a region in Asia that encompasses the countries
located to the south and east of the Asian region, including Brunei,
Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar (also known as
Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. The region is
known for its diverse cultures, tropical climates, beautiful nature,
rich history, and vibrant economies.[^08chapter6_3] Southeast Asia is considered
the most accessible tropical region in the world since it is
strategically located on the sea route between East Asia and the Middle
East-Mediterranean world.[^08chapter6_4] More than a thousand years ago, Southeast
Asia was considered a Suvarnabhūmi (Sanskrit: Land of Gold).[^08chapter6_5] Hence,
this has been the most frequently invaded area by people outside the
region. Chinese, European, Japanese, and American colonization have had
profound impacts on the cultural, economic, and political
characteristics of the area.

From 111 BC to 938 AD, for more than a thousand years, Northern Vietnam
was under Chinese rule.[^08chapter6_6] China has had a long history of cultural,
economic, and political influence in the whole region. In the 19th and
early 20th centuries, the Chinese influence in Southeast Asia became
more intense; large numbers of Chinese immigrants arrived in the region,
particularly in present-day Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[^08chapter6_7]

Various European powers also exerted their influence and control over
Southeast Asia for hundreds of years, including the Portuguese, Spanish,
Dutch, British, and French. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to
arrive in Southeast Asia in the 16th century, establishing colonies in
present-day Indonesia, East Timor, and Malaysia. The Dutch arrived in
the region soon after and established their own colonies, including
present-day Indonesia and parts of Malaysia. In the 19th century, the
British established colonies in present-day Malaysia, Singapore, and
Myanmar (Burma), while the French established colonies in present-day
Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.[^08chapter6_8] These colonial powers brought Western
ideologies and practices to the region which have had a profound impact
on the economies, cultures, and politics of this area.

During World War II, Japanese Fascism invaded most of the former Western
colonies under the concept of *Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity
Sphere*.[^08chapter6_9] The Japanese occupation had significant consequences on the
region, causing widespread suffering, displacement, and economic
disruption. After Japan's defeat in the war, many of the former Western
colonies in Southeast Asia became independent nations.

The United States took the Philippines from Spain in 1898. Internal
autonomy was granted in 1934, and Filipinos celebrated their
independence in 1946.[^08chapter6_10] The US has had a remarkable political,
economic, and military influence in the region throughout the 20th
century and into the 21st century. During the Cold War, the US was
involved in supporting anti-communist governments and military forces in
Southeast Asia, most notably in the conflict in Vietnam that lasted from
1955 to 1975 and had a long-lasting impact on Vietnamese and the
region.[^08chapter6_11]

The consequences of colonialism, independence struggles and wars left
various enduring socio-cultural issues in each country in Southeast
Asia. In the present, living conditions throughout Southeast vary
dramatically from country to country and from rural to urban. In urban
areas, the living conditions in Southeast Asia are convenient, with
access to modern infrastructure such as shopping malls, hospitals, and
international schools. However, in rural areas, the living conditions
are often more modest, with limited access to basic services such as
clean water, electricity, and healthcare. Based on economic situations,
countries like Brunei, Singapore and Malaysia have a high standard of
living, while countries like Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos have a lower
standard of living.[^08chapter6_12]

<br/>

While the level of development in Southeast Asia varies by nation, in
general, it is a region on the road to development with understandable
economic and social limitations. Most inhabitants of the region share a
common desire for improved living standards and economic conditions.
Achieving the goal of a better life is a general human aspiration.
Striving to overcome inferiority, weakness, and disadvantage is a
socially appreciated effort. While the hope of a future characterized by
a higher standard of living motivates Southeast Asians to dream, their
common query is, ‘How can we realize that aspiration? Can the *global
village* fulfill its initial promises? Does the digital environment
implement the expectations of ordinary people? Does the use of products
and services of former mother countries carry one toward the same living
standards as their former colonizers?’

Internet access in Southeast Asia has grown rapidly in recent years. As
of 2021, the percentage of people in Southeast Asia with access to the
internet fell into a range as low as 37% in Timor-Leste to a high of
93.8% in Malaysia. In general, internet penetration is highest in more
developed countries like Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, and lower in
less developed countries like Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Timor-
Leste.[^08chapter6_14]

Southeast Asia is considered to be a rapidly growing market for
e-commerce, with countries like Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the
Philippines witnessing a significant increase in online shopping. The
region is home to over 650 million consumers, making it an attractive
destination for both local and international businesses.[^08chapter6_15] The
factors driving the growth of e-commerce in the region include the
increasing availability of the Internet and mobile devices, the growing
middle class, and a younger demographic that is mainly a digital native
generation, who are familiar and comfortable with online purchases.[^08chapter6_16]
In addition, improvements in logistics and delivery infrastructure make
it more efficient for businesses to reach customers across the region.
As a result, the e-commerce market in Southeast Asia is expected to
continue growing with projections that it could reach over 200 billion
dollars by 2025.[^08chapter6_17] This is considered an emerging digital colonial
market that is the targeted market of not only global digital empires
but also local digital imperials. Former colonized peoples have become
the new colonizers in their own region.

There is a mix of local and international e-commerce platforms operating
in the region, most notably including Lazada, Shopee, Grab, Zalora,
Tokopedia.[^08chapter6_18] All the e-commerce platforms originate from Singapore
and operate extensively throughout Southeast Asia, except for the
Indonesian Tokopedia. The e-commerce platform Lazada was acquired by
China's Alibaba Group in 2016. Alibaba's acquisition of Lazada
exemplifies the efforts to expand its international presence in the
area. There is serious competition between the regional and
international platform companies. However, the regulatory restrictions
and diverse cultural and linguistic differences across the region also
create significant barriers for multinational corporations, giving
opportunities to local platforms. The *cyber-neocolonial* situation in
Southeast Asia has exposed numerous characteristics of classical
colonial concepts, especially the emergence of new empires in the
region.

With a rapidly expanding internet user base and increasing mobile
penetration, digital advertising in Southeast Asia is a significantly
growing industry. Key players in the region include Google, Facebook,
Lazada and TikTok, and regional platforms such as Shopee and Tokopedia.
There is not enough yet consideration of privacy issues and a lack of
common regulations on how to handle personal data in the region, the
basis for targeted advertising to develop rapidly at the moment.[^08chapter6_19]
Various local businesses make efforts to do business and advertise on
social networking platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and
TikTok. Purchasing ads on social networks is vital to the success of
business owners. Selling products through live stream videos on social
networks and the purchase of social network ads have currently become
common business practices in Southeast Asia, especially in Vietnam.

E-commerce in Vietnam has also experienced remarkable growth in recent
years.[^08chapter6_20] Major e-commerce players in the Vietnamese market include
Lazada, Shoppe, and Tiki (a local e-commerce platform), while social
media platforms like Facebook and Instagram are also popular channels
for online shopping. The key platforms in digital advertising in Vietnam
include Facebook, Google, and Zalo (a prominent Vietnamese social media
platform). Social media advertising, video advertising and mobile
advertising are the dominant forms of digital advertising in this
country.

Globalization and integration with the international market system while
reinforcing the growth of local businesses is the challenge of many
developing countries, including Vietnam. This is especially pertinent
for the fields of e-commerce and digital advertising. Multinational
digital platforms have continuously adapted their products or services
to meet the needs and preferences of local markets. They have focused on
improving language functions and creating products and services suitable
to Vietnamese cultural characteristics and tastes. In addition, the
Vietnamese government has also issued policies to encourage the
development of local digital platforms in the country.

Despite being a socialist country, Vietnam has operated a free market
and multi-stakeholder economy since the late 1980s. The State currently
plays the role of coordinating private sector and international trade
through policies and laws. The State-owned companies that were
established during the economic reforms period known as *Đổi mới* (the
1980s) have largely been privatized or sold to the private sector.[^08chapter6_21]
The Vietnamese government, however, implemented different policies
supporting the development of information technology and e-commerce
enterprises.[^08chapter6_22] Tiki and Zalo are two typical representations deriving
significant benefits from the incentives provided by this policy
shift.[^08chapter6_23]

The rapid development of the e-commerce and digital media market in
Vietnam has also created pressure and confusion in dealing with arising
social issues related to this new phenomenon. As a general issue, the
growing power of multinational corporations generates numerous
difficulties in the enactment of law and policy.[^08chapter6_24] The situation has
become more complicated and urgent with the profound impacts of
multinational platforms. In the era of transnational digital
connectivity, international political conditions play a crucial role.
There is an urgent need to unify transnational policies because the
major part of social problems related to the global platforms can only
be solved through the alignment of international law.

As a matter of fact, harmonization of laws is certainly difficult,
especially in Southeast Asia–a region of cultural diversity, language,
and political institutions. Furthermore, remnants of patriotism from the
period of liberation revolutions have made the unifying process more
complex. Various currents of conservative nationalist thought continue
to play a decisive role in numerous parts of this region.[^08chapter6_25] Facing
the social technological challenge, instead of trying to coordinate
regulations, many countries choose to solve their problems locally. In
an effort to control this situation, several governments have employed
algorithms to impose cyber fences and walls within their countries.

## **Cyber Frontier**

For the former colonial countries on the road to development, their
optimistic dreams about *the flat world* are, in fact, simply colorful
and fragile soap bubbles.[^08chapter6_26] The ideas of non-boundary connectivity
exist together with the algorithmic barriers; the dreams of an ideal
cyber life go along with the possibility of being exploited again in
another way; the promised equality cannot bridge social distances
between regions; the collaborative opportunities show the tendency to
becoming a new method of domination; the free market involves various
dependent and controlling factors. The inequality between the capital
owners of AI and users becomes deeper and deeper.

### Digital censorship

To some extent, cyber-colonialism has spread globally with an intense
concentration in developing countries, and obviously in Southeast Asia.
Control, manipulation, and exploitation are practiced by different power
sectors. Cyberspace boundaries have been erected by algorithmic barriers
to create digital censorship. Imposed by governments, private companies,
or other entities, digital censorship is normally claimed with various
reasons, such as protecting national security, preventing the spread of
harmful or offensive content, or suppressing dissenting opinions.
[^08chapter6_27] [^08chapter6_28] Common examples of digital censorship include the
blocking of social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter, the removal
of specific websites or content from search engines, and the use of
filters or firewalls to prevent access to certain types of information
or websites. While digital censorship can be used to protect individuals
or society from harmful content, it can also be used as a tool of
oppression, limiting freedom of expression and restricting access to
information. Clearly, digital censorship might generate negative effects
on individuals and societies, including the limitation of critical
thinking, stifling creativity, and impeding the development of a free
and democratic society.

In parallel to corporate censorship, state censorship also maximizes
efficiency in cyberspace through the use of high-tech automated systems.
The practice of restricting or suppressing online information is seen in
many geographic areas, especially in the Global South. Although the
censorial algorithms are theoretically designed to identify and remove
content without human review or oversight, the major part of digital
censorship formulas is initially programmed and governed by specific
groups or individuals that are likely motivated by specific political or
ideological attitudes. Therefore, the subjective limitations are the
obvious characteristics of censorial algorithms.

In addition, similar to the hidden agenda underlying the mining of
personal data, lack of public transparency over digital censorship in
cyberspace is widespread. With thousands of hidden facts, contemporary
media only reveals to the public what they want users to know. In
developing countries, especially, the ability to participate in social
decisions related to technology-based governance systems is fairly
limited. Surveillance cameras, sensory networks, and cookie protocols
are continuously present in our daily life, but there are various
barriers for the users to understand how they really work and,
therefore, how to change the inequalities associated with the digital
world.

Narrowing the gap between ordinary people and tech owners is
significantly obstructed by a biased legal system. As Pasquale wrote in
*The Black Box Society*

> The law, so aggressively protective of secrecy in the world of
> commerce, is increasingly silent when it comes to the privacy of
> persons… While powerful businesses, financial institutions, and
> government agencies hide their actions behind nondisclosure
> agreements, ‘proprietary methods’, and gag rules, our own lives are
> becoming increasingly open books. Everything we do online is recorded;
> the only questions left are to whom the data will be available, and
> for how long.[^08chapter6_29]

As a matter of fact, human rights in cyberspace are an important issue,
which has not received enough attention in various parts of the world
and, most notably, not in Southeast Asia.

### Digital states

Globally, multinational technology corporations are gradually
establishing various powerful digital states. At the present, Alphabet,
Meta, Amazon, and Alibaba own billions of active accounts, a number much
larger than the population of many countries around the world. In the
Southeast Asia region, there are over 400 million internet users[^08chapter6_30] and,
among them, young people between the ages of 16 and 24 are spending an
average of 10 hours a day in cyberspace.[^08chapter6_31]

![Figure 6.2: Daily Time Spent With Media: S.E. Asia Young Adults.

<br/>

With a large number and active participation, platform corporations have
made a profound impact on society and especially on young people.
Therefore, a single activity on any given platform can cause an
immediate effect on a large population. For example, changes to
Facebook's algorithm that decides how content is prioritized in
newsfeeds of individual users can have a major impact on user
perceptions. Similarly, changes to privacy settings or data collection
policies can significantly limit the use of features on the platform.
The operating regulations of platforms play a similar role to governing
regulations of states. By agreeing on the user contracts, we might say
that customers have applied for immigration to these digital states.

From user perspective, these types of digital states also generate
similar feelings of belonging or personal identity within communities.
For example, many people who regularly use Instagram might have a clear
sense of identity concerning the Instagram community. *Instagrammers*
commonly share various social and cultural norms such as women's beauty
standards. Feelings of dependency on platforms can be fleeting or deep;
however, they are common sense.

Furthermore, platform corporations also emphasize their state characters
in their imperialist act of annexation. At the present, Google,
Facebook, and Amazon are the dominant empires in the West.[^08chapter6_32] Baidu,
Alibaba, Tencent, and Xiaomi of China are trying to expand their
dominance in the Eastern Region.[^08chapter6_33] These companies are constantly
expanding their power by acquiring smaller companies, especially as it
becomes public and a potential threat. Google itself is among the most
prolific acquirers of start-up companies; at some stages, it has
purchased a new venture weekly.[^08chapter6_34] Facebook has also swallowed
Instagram (\$1bn), WhatsApp (\$19bn), and Oculus (\$2bn) and invested in
drone-based internet, e-commerce, and payment services.[^08chapter6_35] In 2016,
Alibaba acquired a controlling stake in Lazada–a leading e-commerce
platform in Southeast Asia, for \$1 billion[^08chapter6_36]; in 2018, it also acquired
Daraz–an e-commerce platform in South Asia that operates in Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Nepal.[^08chapter6_37]

The takeover of other companies has become a common strategy of
technology corporations. These acquisitions mostly aim to achieve
economies of scale, expand into new markets, acquire new technologies or
intellectual property, and diversify their product or service offerings.
The most important reason, however, is to eliminate threats from rivals
and strengthen the power of the empire. Intensive competition is now
observed between platform corporations, international technology
companies, and local ones. It seems inevitable that small, local
companies that do not transform into multinationals and acquire rivals
will become the targets of the next acquisition.

There is a large technological capital gap between developing and
developed countries, especially in AI capital ownership. In Southeast
Asia, currently, the distribution of access to and use of digital
technologies such as the Internet, computers, and smartphones is no
longer as difficult as it was in prior decades. However, the ability to
access and own AI capital remains a distant prospect. There is a
requirement for a massive and advanced digital infrastructure to nurture
AI and exploit Big data on the Internet through algorithms. Meanwhile,
most server farms–the brains of AI, and technologies related to machine
learning applications are the property of platform corporations. Even
the US government must spend public money to rent cloud computing
services from the clouds of Amazon or Microsoft.[^08chapter6_38] Clearly, owning
such a progressive infrastructure is much more difficult for developing
countries. AI has become a target of the race among tech giants. As Amy
Webb mentioned that ‘The supranational flatforms are the most control
over the future of AI’.[^08chapter6_39] The potential for big tech empires to
monopolize cyberspace into the future is strong, limiting the
opportunity for developing countries to own of AI technology.

Furthermore, in developing regions, public information technology
systems have now become outdated and inefficient. Non-commercial
organizations (such as political parties, associations and religious
organizations) cannot rely totally on classical public media to
advertise their propaganda as in the past. Media systems of global
platforms have gradually subsumed the market share, influencing public
communication significantly. Reacting to this loss, plenteous
governments have introduced new laws and policies to control the
platforms and convert privately owned social networking spaces into
national online spaces. Likewise, several governments have attempted to
establish their own digital communication systems and social network
infrastructure. They normally require or even oblige citizens to use
this infrastructure. For example, China banned the operation of global
platforms operating on their territory, and the Chinese government now
restricts their population to the use of only national
applications.[^08chapter6_40]

Digital inequality in cyberspace has also been reflected in labour
peculiarities in the information technology industry. There is a
contrasting picture between the *tech elite* and the slavery working
group in the technology industry. Generally, the tech elite are are
typically highly educated and experienced in the fields of science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and they often hold
leadership positions at major tech companies or venture capital firms.
The majority of tech-elite individuals live and work in developed
countriesm, and they are known for their high salaries, access to
exclusive networks and events, and influence over the direction of the
technology industry. In the humorous words of Lovink, ‘The tech
elite—the group of (usually young, white and male) developers as a
*pure* medium; an abstract mathematical environment, untouched by
society, neutral of class, gender or race, capable of *routing around*
the problems caused by the dirty old world outside’.[^08chapter6_41] The social
impacts of the tech-elite are enormous in the digital era. Many machine
decisions are influenced by their creators of various algorithms. For
example, at present, the right of decision-making on blocked
information, target audience, and government loans is mostly based on
programming formulas. As Tristan Harris stated during the Congressional
Hearing in the US on January 8, 2020: ‘Never before in history have 50
designers made decisions that would have an impact on two billion
people.’[^08chapter6_42]

Meanwhile, many workers serving in the technological industry are based
in low-wage regions such as nations in the southern hemisphere and
developing countries. These worker positions are often ‘shaped by
implicit ideas that such populations don’t need—or are less deserving
of—livable wages and economic stability.’[^08chapter6_43] The lives of low-wage
workers are impacted by the precarious living standards of the
localities where they reside. To some extent, low-income tech workers
suffer from a new form of slave exploitation. At present, we do not see
large-scale labor exploitation through slavery, which often requires
spreading racist beliefs that dehumanized entire populations in the last
centuries.[^08chapter6_44] Neo-slavery developed on the background of cheap and
precarious exploitative labor practices.[^08chapter6_45] Regularly, low-income tech
workers are assigned to simple jobs that serve the system processes and
are paid according to the practice of piece work.

For example, to learn about this job market, Elisa Giardina Papa, an
Italian artist, worked remotely for several North American
*human-in-the-loop* companies that provide *clean* datasets to train AI
algorithms to detect emotions.[^08chapter6_46] Among the tasks that the artist
performed were categorizing emotions, annotation of facial expressions
and recording her own image to animate three-dimensional
characters.[^08chapter6_47] The purposes of this work are used either to identify
the moods of consumers or to detect potentially dangerous citizens who
pose a threat to the state. Numerous tech workers in developing
countries received similarly small tasks, working 15 to 18 hours a day
to earn a small amount of income. Various tech companies are pushing
these people into slave working conditions. Naomi Klein claimed that
‘Job cannot call a real job when it does not provide the workers with
the proper working conditions, working benefits for a sustainable
living.’[^08chapter6_48]

The situation of this labour inequality tends to increase with the
development of technology. The automation era will first affect
precarious technology worker groups. Automatic programming software that
offers the similar performance of IT engineers has now become more
popular. With limited access to advanced training, tech workers in
developing countries are considered basic-skill working groups that are
most likely to be replaced by machines. Although digital states are
identified as Virtual World entities, their geography is still
interpreted in many ways, one of which is the specificity of the
technological labour force.

In addition, technology corporations also pay attention to geographical
aspects when considering the possible technologically experimental or
trial markets. In 2017, Facebook launched its online shopping platform,
Marketplace, in several Asian countries, including India, Indonesia, and
Thailand.[^08chapter6_49] In 2019, Amazon began to test its cashier-less
convenience store concept, Amazon Go, in Mexico City.[^08chapter6_50] In the
article *South Africa’s Private Surveillance Machine is Fueling a
Digital Dpartheid* Karen Hao and Heidi Swartz specifically described how
tech corporations in South Africa have been using AI surveillance tools
to monetize their private security surveillance business.[^08chapter6_51] Tracking
population movement and facial recognition systems to trace individuals
is being done through thousands of private cameras in Johannesburg.[^08chapter6_52]
Public data has been stored by private companies and commercialized
freely on the market. This surveillance application is considered to be
the initial trial for the further surveillance systems of the other
continents.

Testing new IT applications in developing countries is a simple,
inexpensive, and efficient investment. From a different perspective,
however, this can be considered an inhumane act directed toward those
disadvantaged groups that doesn’t hold the tools, abilities and legal
conditions to defend themselves.

## Digital and nondigital

The combination of different technologies has currently submerged people
in the mixed world of real and virtual. The actual actions of users
confirm the effectiveness of advertising messages on the internet , and
partisan propaganda verifies the level of influence in each
administrative region.

Tracking users with devices such as personal phones, security cameras,
and automatic audio receivers, digital providers easily monitor and
control the real-time actions of users. The actions of tagging people
and locations on social media are an example of effective methods for
tracking and collecting information. An additional efficient method for
locating users is the *location tracking feature* on mobile devices.
Placing a virtual assistant like Amazon's Alexa in customer homes is a
deceptive way to harvest private information on intimate relationships,
and the use of electronic payments through payment platforms such as
PayPal or Wise is a form of tracking personal financial situation.

To confirm the effectiveness of advertising and propaganda messages in
digital space, the current machine learning methods are able to connect
personal information in physical and virtual spaces instantly. Using a
typical tracking process as an example, the AI system notes user
interests through search engines, and then sends targeted advertising.
When the customer initially views an advertisement, a first-time fee is
paid to the publisher by the advertiser. Subsequent and additional fees
are paid as users click on various embedded links. This complex process
of manipulation connects individual pieces of data regarding how the
user interacts with published advertisements with data regarding user
geolocation, time, electronic payment and electronic election
transactions.

At the moment, users in general and, specifically, those in developing
countries are controlled and exploited using multiple strategies,
ranging from simple devices to more advanced AI technology, from global
to local forces, from both physical and mental influences. For economic
benefits, digital owners apply various tactics and strategies.
Ironically, even Google recognized its own influence when it began to
use the slogan ‘Don't Be Evil’ in 2000s.[^08chapter6_53] As Coeckelbergh warned,
‘AI may lead to new forms of manipulation, surveillance, and
totalitarianism, not necessarily in the form of authoritarian politics
but in a more hidden and highly effective way’.[^08chapter6_54]

Southeast Asians have been eager to find a new horizon and to undertake
an emotional, mental, and physical migration to the digital world.
However, the reality may lead them to consider what they need to face
and solve. They should navigate the digital native generations
especially, to an equal path. Decolonizing cyberspace is a crucial
action. Raising the awareness of existential problems to the public is a
current focus. Technology skills education for the younger generation is
essential. The overall community retains responsibility for limiting the
negative effects of the platform economy. Taking radical actions to stop
AI surveillance, data collection, and targeted economics will be the
hope to free people in former colonial regions and arrest new forms of
exploitation.

In Southeast Asia, a limited number of community actions focused on
these issues have been launched, the forthcoming Asia-Pacific Digital
Rights Festival being one of them.[^08chapter6_55] The week-long festival in May
2023 in Chiang Mai, Thailand aims to promote and protect digital rights
in the Asia-Pacific and is expected to be the largest-ever gathering
focused on this region. The 3rd ASEAN Digital Ministers’ meeting, which
took place on February 2023, was also organized to conduct general
discussions on new policies related to artificial Intelligence
technologies, leading towards an innovative, responsible and secure
ecosystem in the region.[^08chapter6_56]

Southeast Asia is an experimental, data, consumer, advertising and
labour market for AI capitalist corporations. AI is considered to be the
foundational infrastructure of 21st-century society.[^08chapter6_57] Are developing
countries in Southeast Asia able to own AI capital without the
revolution that would turn it into public ownership? This question might
not be answered with a conservative-nationalist approach. Moving towards
regional and global integration is essential for securing an equal
future for the global population in general, and for the people of
Southeast Asia region in particular.
